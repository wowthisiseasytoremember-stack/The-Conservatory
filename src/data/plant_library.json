      "description": "Description\n\nAcmella repens, the Oppositeleaf spotflower, is a little known, rare stem plant. It occurs as a swamp plant in the warmer parts of the Americas from the southern USA to Paraguay in several wet places and is able to grow submerged. Aquarists collected it in Texas years ago and discovered its suitability as aquarium plant. Since around 2012 it is also known in Europe. Acmella repens belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is closely related with the Pará cress or Jambú (Acmella oleracea). It resembles Gymnocoronis spilanthoides except that it is considerably smaller. In its suberged form it grows strictly upright with quite long internodes and opposite, egg-shaped, medium green leaves. Strong lighting causes red-brown coloration of the stems, petioles and leaf midribs. When it is allowed to grow out of the water, one may expect its nice little yellow inflorescences that resemble tiny sunflowers.\n\nThis plant is not very demanding but benefits much from a good micro- and macronutrient and CO2 supply. Moderate lighting is sufficient while strong lighting enhances the red-brown tones of the otherwise green plant. Temperatures between about 16 and 29 °C are favourable. Acmella repens is best planted in a group of stems with a bit of space to each other. It is propagated by cuttings as well as other stem plants. Once it happened for us that its leaves were eaten by Amano shrimps (Caridina multidentata), so care must be taken when it is planted in an aquarium with many Amano shrimps.\n\nWith its upright, symmetrical habit, the Oppositeleaf Spotflower is well suited for \"plant streets\" in Dutch style aquariums. It looks like a miniature version of Gymnocoronis spilanthoides and is easier to handle than this huge stem plant. In its emersed form, this plant from the subtropical to tropical America also appears interesting for paludariums and Wabi-Kusa.",
      "notes": "Acmella repens is a plant from the Asteraceae family growing in the southeast of the USA, from Texas to North Carolina, as well as in Central and South America, from Mexico to Paraguaygeneralreferences#1. This relatively small plant with its yellow flowers occurs in disturbed, wet or drying-out locationsgeneralreferences#2. It belongs to the same genus as the medical/spice plant paracress or jambú (Acmella oleracea).\n\nOnly a short time ago, aquaristis from the USA have discovered that Acmella repens, which they collected in Texas, can be cultivated submersed. Outside the USA it is hardly known as aquarium plant yet.\n\n- To be continued -\n\nSynonyms\tAnthemis repens Walter, Acmella oppositifolia var. repens (Walter) R. K.

We offer the dwarf cultivar 'Pusillus' that mostly gets only about 10, at most 15 cm high. It is also named as a variety, Acorus gramineus var. pusillus. Otherwise, wild types of Acorus gramineus may get 30-50 cm tall.\n\nThe Japanese rush is often regarded as of limited value for aquariums. However, we found out that at least the Dwarf sweet flag, Acorus gramineus 'Pusillus', can be grown permanently submerged.

It should be fastened to objects such as stone or wood where it attaches itself by its roots, or fixed to the ground, comparable to Anubias species or Java fern. The growth is very slow, and with time side branches on the rhizome may appear that can be cut off for propagation. We recommend complete macro- and micronutrient supply via the water column, CO2 addition and good current. Medium lighting is sufficient.

      "description": "Description\n\nAlternanthera reineckii 'Mini' is an exquisite dwarf parrot leaf cultivar. It became known in Europe around 2007 under the name Alternanthera reineckii \"rosaefolia minor\". The species A. reineckii is native to wetlands in tropical and subtropical South America, but we have no information about the exact origin of the \"Mini\" form.\nThis plant grows much more compactly under water and also somewhat slower than other A. reineckii forms. It can be pruned to form a beautiful, purple-red to brown-red coloured carpet or compact bush about 5 cm high and is then suitable for the aquarium foreground and nano aquariums. Without pruning, the plant will grow to around 20 cm high over time, but will remain quite bushy due to branching. The leaves can grow to around 5 cm long and 1.4 cm wide, but are often smaller. Many water roots grow on old stems, but these are unlikely to be visually disturbing due to the bushy growth of the plant.\nEmersed Alternanthera reineckii 'Mini' grows significantly taller (at least 30 cm) and more elongated than the submersed form, with longer internodes and more green leaves. Emersed potted plants from the trade therefore hardly differ from other A. reineckii cultivars. However, compact shoots with much shorter internodes develop under water.\n\nLike other Alternanthera reineckii forms, the Mini parrot leaf is a moderately demanding plant that grows best with rather high light levels, temperatures of around 22 - 28 °C, a complete supply of macro and micronutrients and CO2 supplementation. Plants from tissue culture cups should be divided into smaller portions after washing off the culture medium and placed in the substrate with some space between them. The long stems of emersed pot plants are best cut into terminal cuttings and partial cuttings with about 1 - 2 stem nodes and placed in the substrate. When the plant has grown to a height of at least 5 cm, the shoot tips can be cut to encourage branching. The cut tips can in turn be used as cuttings. Propagation by dividing the compact bushes is also possible.\n\nThis compact, relatively slow-growing Alternanthera is one of the relatively few brown-red plants for the aquarium foreground. Alternanthera reineckii 'Mini' can be used in a variety of ways, for example as a red, contrasting sprinkling in carpets of light green plants or in the middle ground as a rather low \"plant street\" in Dutch style.",

Ammania gracilis is probably the most popular of the genus due to its beauty and its moderate requirements.\n\nAlthough A. gracilis may be an uncomplicated stem plant, it only shows its full potential under strong lights; moreover, it needs sufficient amounts of CO2 (25-30 mg/l). It prefers soft and slightly acidic water, but adapts well to more extreme water parameters. Nitrate and phosphate should be added to the tank, as well as iron and other micronutrients. A lack of iron shows in fading leaf colour, whereas too ample a provision leads to longer stems and a less intensive red (a high nitrate content also leads to the leaves turning green). A.

The species differs only slightly from Ammannia auriculata. Underwater it grows with strong, upright shoots that can become about 14 cm wide. The stems are light green, but reddish at the nodes and shoot tips. The elongate-lanceolate leaves reach about 6–8 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width when submerged and show a fresh green, often with yellowish to slightly reddish tones at the shoot tips. In its terrestrial form, the leaves remain smaller and narrower, and the plant produces numerous small pink flowers in the leaf axils.

However, so far we have kept it only in soft water, under intense lighting, with CO₂ addition and full nutrient supply via the water column, and not yet tested it under higher carbonate hardness and moderate lighting. But we have never observed growth disorders in A. multiflora, such as those that occur in Ammannia gracilis even with slight nutrient imbalances. The plant looks best when allowed to grow to a height of about 30–40 cm. Due to its rapid growth, regular trimming is necessary, otherwise, the plant will grow out of the water and start to flower. Propagation is easily achieved through top cuttings.\n\nWith its regular, strictly upright growth habit, Ammannia multiflora is particularly suitable for tall planted aquariums in the Dutch style. Its colour range from fresh green to light reddish tones forms a beautiful contrast to dark plants and dark hardscape. The species is especially effective as a background plant in tanks over 40 cm in height.

Recently, Christel Kasselmann (2010) described it as a variety (var. coffeifolia) or Anubias barteri. It can be discerned from other A. barteri varities by its orange-brown sprouting leaves that turn dark green later on. Its new leaf stalks are brownish red, and the tissue between the lateral veins is strongly arched, which strongly reminds of the leaves of the coffee bush (Coffea).\n\nThis plant grows very slowly when cultivated sumbersed. It has a creeping rhizome and should (like all other varieties of Anubias barteri) be bound to rocks or driftwood with twine. There it will attach itself with its roots.

This white pattern is not always equally pronounced; at times pure green leaves may appear. The plant is also called Anubias minima 'Variegated' or 'Variegata'. Like the wild type, this Anubias is characterised by a distinctive narrow leaf shape.\nThe plant forms a strong, creeping rhizome (rootstock) with long, branched adhesive roots. With the leaves it reaches at least 12 cm in height. The leaves have approx. 8 cm long upright petioles and 12 cm long, 2.8 cm wide, horizontally spreading blades.

There is hardly any information about these locations, though. Tropica was the first to cultivate this dwarf variety in 1970 and brought it into the hobby. Anubias barteri var. nana is one of the most widely spread aquarium plants in Europe, Asia and the US.\n\nThis plant is almost indestructible in an aquarium, and is thus often called a \"growing plastic plant\".\n\nThe plant itself consists of a creeping rhizom from which leaves grow that may last several years.

A complete supply of macro and micronutrients via the water column is recommended. The addition of CO<sub>2</sub> is not a must, but promotes growth greatly. Like other forms of Anubias barteri, the cultivar 'Golden Heart' is primarily a perching plant that attaches itself to hard substrates such as stone and wood with its roots. However, it can also be attached to the substrate, although the rhizome should not be buried as it could otherwise rot.</p>\n\n<p>Perching plants for the hardscape usually have dark to medium green colours, but Anubias barteri var. nana 'Golden Heart' is an exception with its yellow and light green tones. It forms a beautiful contrast to dark backgrounds or dark green plants and mosses.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

Grown under water, its overall size stays smaller than that of the terrestrial plant. Medium lighting is recommended. It can be fastened to the hardscape and also to the ground, provided that the rhizome is not buried. This Anubias also grows easily as emersed plant under humid conditions with damp air.\n\nIn small tanks, Anubias heterophylla can be planted in the background, otherwise it's best placed on the hardscape in the midground.

This species is quite long known in the aquarium hobby, sometimes also traded with the label \"Anubias undulata\".</p>\n<p>As well as the Anubias barteri varieties, A. heterophylla is an easy, robust, slowly growing aquarium plant. Grown under water, its overall size stays smaller than that of the terrestrial plant. Medium lighting is recommended. It can be fastened to the hardscape and also to the ground, provided that the rhizome is not buried. This Anubias also grows easily as emersed plant under humid conditions with damp air.</p>\n<p>In small tanks, Anubias heterophylla can be planted in the background, otherwise it's best placed on the hardscape in the midground. It is also interesting for the water edge of rainforest paludaria and terraria.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "Aponogeton robinsonii is rather rare in the aquarium hobby. It occurs in central and southern Vietnam as well as in Laos in slow-flowing rivers with very soft water, on muddy as well as on rocky substrate. Typical A. robinsonii is a plant that mainly develops floating leaves. There are also plants under that name that develop long, ribbon-shaped, wavy submerged leaves but no true floating leaves. They were first imported by Ingo Hertel in 1981 and commonly known as \"normal\" A. robinsonii. However these plants correspond with Aponogeton eberhardtii that was described as a separate species by A. Camus in 1912. A. eberhardtii is only known from Vietnam and was treated as a synonym of A. robinsonii for a long time. However, Josef Bogner (2018) and Helmut Mühlberg concluded that A. eberhardtii is distinguishable as a separate species.

Several forms of this species are in cultivation, among others a smaller-leaved form and a variegated form. The latter is not too different from the standard form, though. One of the most striking characteristics of this plant is the lemon scent the leaves emit when crushed. The basis of the ovate leaves encloses the stem entirely.\n\nThis stem plant doesn't grow very fast, but needs lots and lots of light, at least 0.5 watts per litre. It grows slightly better when fertilised with micro and macronutrients, this is relatively unimportant, though, as well as a fertilisation with CO2.

      "description": "Description\n\n\"Purple\" is a spectacular colour form of Salzmann's water hyssop. It apparently came onto the market later than another rather green to reddish form of Bacopa salzmannii, which was first called Bacopa sp. \"Araguaia\". The submerged leaves of Bacopa salzmanniii \"Purple\", on the other hand, develop striking dark reddish-purple tones. The leaf midrib and lateral veins are darker in colour. The shoots grow upright under water and branch little. They grow at least 30 cm high and about 4 cm wide. The underwater leaves are ovate, up to 2.2 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. They form a colour contrast to the rather light green, thick stem.\n\nThe species Bacopa salzmannii is not yet as common in the aquarium hobby as Bacopa caroliniana. It has similar, but under the same conditions smaller leaves on a thick stem. It is common in tropical, seasonally dry areas from Mexico to Argentina, as an annual plant in wetlands. In its terrestrial form, the plant grows prostrate. The leaves are then rather dark green, and quite long-stalked purple flowers appear in the leaf axils. The stem is hairy in both the emersed and the submerged stage. Bacopa salzmannii \"Purple\" is not to be confused with Bacopa caroliniana \"Colorata\".\n\nBacopa salzmannii is not a particularly difficult plant, but we recommend medium to strong lighting and complete macro- and micronutrient supply via the water column. A nutrient-rich substrate and CO2 addition are also advantageous. Growth is moderately fast. The plant produces plenty of side shoots after cutting, so propagation by head cuttings and partial cuttings is easy. In our experience, the shoots tend to become bare at the bottom from a height of approx. 30 cm. We recommend not letting the stand grow much taller than 25 cm by pruning and replanting shoot tips./p>\n\nBacopa salzmannii \"Purple\" combines an unusual, intense colouring with moderate cultivation requirements. As a medium-high, up to about 25 cm tall stand in the aquarium midground, it sets a striking red-purple accent that contrasts especially with light green plants. In the rather creeping, more green terrestrial form, the plant is interesting for paludariums and wabi-kusa, where you can also count on its pretty purple flowers.",

They form a colour contrast to the rather light green, thick stem.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./bilder/kk_dropper_uploads/dt_Bacopa_salzmannii_Purple_135.0784.00_01_beschreibungsfoto_klein.jpg\" data-large-image=\"./bilder/kk_dropper_uploads/dt_Bacopa_salzmannii_Purple_135.0784.00_01_beschreibungsfoto_gross.jpg\" alt=\"Submers\"></p>\n<p>\nThe species Bacopa salzmannii is not yet as common in the aquarium hobby as Bacopa caroliniana. It has similar, but under the same conditions smaller leaves on a thick stem. It is common in tropical, seasonally dry areas from Mexico to Argentina, as an annual plant in wetlands. In its terrestrial form, the plant grows prostrate. The leaves are then rather dark green, and quite long-stalked purple flowers appear in the leaf axils. The stem is hairy in both the emersed and the submerged stage. Bacopa salzmannii \"Purple\" is not to be confused with Bacopa caroliniana \"Colorata\".</p>\n<p>Bacopa salzmannii is not a particularly difficult plant, but we recommend medium to strong lighting and complete macro- and micronutrient supply via the water column. A nutrient-rich substrate and CO<sub>2</sub> addition are also advantageous. Growth is moderately fast. The plant produces plenty of side shoots after cutting, so propagation by head cuttings and partial cuttings is easy. In our experience, the shoots tend to become bare at the bottom from a height of approx. 30 cm. We recommend not letting the stand grow much taller than 25 cm by pruning and replanting shoot tips./p&gt;\n</p>\n<p>Bacopa salzmannii \"Purple\" combines an unusual, intense colouring with moderate cultivation requirements. As a medium-high, up to about 25 cm tall stand in the aquarium midground, it sets a striking red-purple accent that contrasts especially with light green plants. In the rather creeping, more green terrestrial form, the plant is interesting for paludariums and wabi-kusa, where you can also count on its pretty purple flowers.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

Its elongate, almost arrow-shaped, wavy, soft leaves get more than 30 cm long and sit in a rosette on a tuber-like or elongate rhizome.

The delicate leaves are prone to damage by snails. This plant is primarily propagated by sowing; it also develops fruits with seeds when the flowers remain below the water surface.

      "notes": "Barclaya longifolia, which belongs to the Nymphaceae family, is found in large parts of Southeast Asia. However, this plant does not form any floating leaves even though it is technically spoken a water lily. Its elongated, reddish to green, wavy leaves make it look like a Cryptocoryne at first glance, at least as long as the plant is still young. However, the plant soon grows to a size comparable to a large Echinodorus. There is a red and a green variety, the latter with a reddish leaf underside. The green variety grows a little larger than the red one.\n\nLike other Nymphaeaceae, Barclaya longifolia can be kept small for a longer time when its roots are restricted, e.g. by planting into a small pot. In general, this Barclaya is a relatively undemanding plant as long as it gets sufficient light and warm water (not under 24 °C).

      "description": "Description\n\nThe African water fern is a beautiful, time-tested aquatic fern with transparent bottle green pinnate fronds. It has a wide distribution across tropical Africa, growing attached to rock along the mean waterline of fast-flowing waters, partly together with Anubias species. Also under aquarium conditions, Bolbitis heudelotii attaches itself to solid objects by its blackish roots, but it will also grow when it is fastened to the substrate surface. Just make sure you do not cover the rhizome as it might otherwise rot away.\nBolbitis heudelotii is mostly delivered in its emersed (terrestrial) form. The emersed fronds mostly look different to the submerged foliage, and blackish leaf tips or spots are frequent. This does not mean in any way that its vitality is reduced. Good growth conditions provided, the plant will develop new entirely green submerged foliage without dark tips or spots.\n\nGrowth is sped up a lot by the addition of CO2 and fertilisation via the water column. Bolbitis heudelotii develops best in soft, slightly acidic water, however, it is a relatively undemanding plant and will also grow in medium-hard water. The plant has a low light demand but also thrives with intense lighting when a good nutrient and CO2 supply is provided. This fern is easy to propagate: Simply cut the creeping rhizome. When the bush has become too large, Bolbitis heudelotii tolerates hard pruning.\n\nThe African water fern is a popular plant in aquascaping, where it is mainly used for decorating the hardscape (rocks and driftwood). It is especially nice in Nature Aquaria, but also highly decorative in every standard planted tank.",
      "notes": "Bolbitis heudelotii (Bory ex FÉE) Alston, or African water fern, is widely distributed in the African tropics. There it grows attached to rocks or driftwood with its roots, in spray zones and inundation areas of rapidly flowing rivers and rivulets. In West Afrika it is often found in the same habitats as Anubias barteri varieties.\n\nVery much like Java fern (Microsorum pteropus) and Anubias, Bolbitis heudelotii possesses a creeping rhizome, on which the leaves and roots grow. Its submersed leaves are single to double pinnate, transparent and bottle-green, whereas the emersed leaves are single pinnate, of a matte green, and rather hard. The entire plant is brittle.\nThere seem to be several forms of B. heudelotii in cultivation, which differ a bit even when kept under the same conditions.

      "description": "Description\n\nAccording to Tropica, this fantastic epiphyte belongs to Bucephalandra sordidula. This is a variable species that occurs in the province of West Kalimantan on Borneo. Like other Bucephalandras, it grows there on rocks along fast-flowing rainforest streams. However, Bucephalandra sordidula 'Blue' is very different from the B. sordidula form, which was introduced as Bucephalandra sp. \"Melawi\". It has a much broader, oval leaf shape and the leaf margin is barely wavy.\nThe submerged leaves of Bucephalandra sordidula 'Blue' have a distinct bluish colour. This plant is extremely easy to care for and thrives in different water values and light levels.\n\nAlthough Bucephalandra species and forms are usually only temporarily flooded in their natural habitats, they can grow permanently under water. They are primarily perching plants that attach themselves to rock or wood with their roots. However, they can also be attached to the substrate, but the rhizome should not be buried as this could cause it to rot. The plant will then root itself and benefit from the nutrients in the substrate. Growth is generally slow.\nBucephalandras can cope with low light, but develop best with medium light intensity, a constant supply of CO2 and nutrients and good water movement. Strong lighting is tolerated if the nutrient and CO2 supply is sufficient. The temperature can be between around 20 and 27 °C.\nWe recommend placing Bucephalandras in tanks that are already biologically established. It is best to leave them to grow undisturbed for a longer period. Sudden changes in conditions can cause the leaves to fall off, but the plants usually slowly produce new shoots on the rhizome afterwards.\nBucephalandras are propagated by cutting off side shoots or head shoots, which also promotes branching of the shoots.\n\nBucephalandra sordidula 'Blue' combines ease of care with a fascinating appearance. This rather small plant is best placed on the hardscape in the midground or as a foreground plant. With its bluish colour, it adds a touch of elegance to the aquarium. Its slow growth means it requires little maintenance and always looks neat and tidy. With its rather dark colour tones, this Bucephalandra contrasts with fresh green mosses, for example.",

This plant is extremely easy to care for and thrives in different water values and light levels.</p>\n\n<p>Although Bucephalandra species and forms are usually only temporarily flooded in their natural habitats, they can grow permanently under water. They are primarily perching plants that attach themselves to rock or wood with their roots. However, they can also be attached to the substrate, but the rhizome should not be buried as this could cause it to rot. The plant will then root itself and benefit from the nutrients in the substrate. Growth is generally slow. <br>Bucephalandras can cope with low light, but develop best with medium light intensity, a constant supply of CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrients and good water movement. Strong lighting is tolerated if the nutrient and CO<sub>2</sub> supply is sufficient. The temperature can be between around 20 and 27 °C.\n<br>We recommend placing Bucephalandras in tanks that are already biologically established. It is best to leave them to grow undisturbed for a longer period. Sudden changes in conditions can cause the leaves to fall off, but the plants usually slowly produce new shoots on the rhizome afterwards. \n<br>Bucephalandras are propagated by cutting off side shoots or head shoots, which also promotes branching of the shoots.</p>\n\n<p>Bucephalandra sordidula 'Blue' combines ease of care with a fascinating appearance. This rather small plant is best placed on the hardscape in the midground or as a foreground plant. With its bluish colour, it adds a touch of elegance to the aquarium. Its slow growth means it requires little maintenance and always looks neat and tidy. With its rather dark colour tones, this Bucephalandra contrasts with fresh green mosses, for example.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

Bucephalandras do best with medium lighting, regular CO<sub>2</sub> and nutrient supply via the water column and good water current. The propagation is easily done by cuttings of the shoots.</p>\n<p>This quite broad-leaved Bucephalandra is highly recommended for the hardscape where it draws attention by its blue-green gleaming leaves.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nBucephalandra sp. \"Kedagang\" is a rather small, particularly distinctive form of Bucephalandra. Its species identity and exact location are not known to us, but the trade name \"Kedagang\" probably refers to the town of Kudangan in South Kalimantan. The so-called Bucephalandra sp. \"Mini\" sold as a tissue culture plant is apparently identical to \"Kedagang\".\nThe elongated leaves are approx. 4 to 5.5 cm long and 0.8 to 1.2 cm wide with the petiole, and are overcurved. The petiole is about 0.6 to 1 cm long. The leaf margin is finely curled and bent upwards. The leaves have a very dark brown to green colour with a bluish sheen on the upper side and are covered with silvery dots. The underside of the leaves is silvery-white to pale violet in colour. The rhizome tips and young leaf stalks are wine-red in colour. The rhizome grows creeping to ascending and branches out, forming a multi-headed group over time. This Bucephalandra rarely flowers in the aquarium.\n\nCompared to other Bucephalandra forms, \"Kedagang\" is quite vigorous.

It is a great plant for coldwater tanks as well as tropical tanks that are not kept too warm, which makes it a very popular, easy-to-obtain aquarium plant.\n\nJapanese cress is a fast-growing creeping stem plant easy in cultivation. Its tendriouls stems carry light green kidney-shaped leaves. Under insufficient light (less than 0.5 watts per litre) the stems grow very thin and the leaves stay significantly smaller. C. lyrata grows well even without the addition of CO2, however, carbon dioxide fertilisation enhances growth. Leaf size seems to be dependent on temperature. Colder water of around 20 °C furthers the formation of larger leaves, whereas temperatures of around 24 °C and over result in tiny leaves.\n\nC.

Many young plantlets (adventitious plantlets) form on older floating leaves.\n\nAs a floating aquarium plant, Ceratopteris pteridoides needs above all a plentiful nutrient supply and good lighting. The favourable temperatures lie between about 18 and 30 °C. Nutrient deficiency or imbalance may lead to pale new leaves and poor growth. Under favourable conditions this fern may get large within a quite short period. If the leaf rosettes have become too large for the tank, they can be replaced by some of the many young plantlets that develop on old, also detached leaves.\nYoung plants from tissue culture are often entangled and not easy to separate from each other.

In some tropical regions of Asia the emersed leaves of this species are used as vegetable. In nature, this plant is said to be an annual plant, however, it can be cultivated over several years without problems. The species contains many local forms, and in aquaristics, varietys with more coarsely or finely pinnate submersed leaves are common (photos 1 to 3 show an especially delicate form of C. thalictroides). The species has been known in the hobby for many years, also under the synonym of Ceratopteris siliquosa as well as under the vernacular names of water sprite, Indian fern, Oriental waterfern and water hornfern.

It belongs in the C. wendtii group, it is readily available and it has been in use in aquaristics for over 60 years.\n\nIt is very easy to cultivate, and possesses the typical characteristics of a Cryptocoryne from Sri Lanka. It adapts well to soft as well as to hard water, light is relatively unimportant, even though it grows better under more intensive light. The brown-green rosettes that form soon after the plant is placed in the tank spread quickly and form dense bushes. Nutrient-rich substrates enhance growth. The plant reacts nicely to ample fertilisation and to CO2, but it grows sufficiently well without these components, too. It may be cultivated emersed in moist substrates rich in nutrients, where it is known to flower.

      "notes": "The triploid form of Cryptocoryne beckettii was originally described as a species on its own, namely Cryptocoryne petchii. However, this beautiful and very widely spread plant, which belongs in the C. wendtii group, is readily available and has been in use in aquaristics for over 60 years.\n\nIt is very easy to cultivate, and possesses the typical characteristics of a Cryptocoryne from Sri Lanka. It adapts well to soft as well as to hard water, light is relatively unimportant, even though it grows better under more intensive light. The brown-green rosettes that form soon after the plant is placed in the tank spread quickly and form dense bushes. Nutrient-rich substrates enhance growth. The plant reacts nicely to ample fertilisation and to CO2, but it grows sufficiently well without these components, too.

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Siamese water trumpet is a variety of Cryptocoryne cordata from the south of Thailand. There it occurs in calcareous, shaded flowing waters, in contrast to the type variety Cryptocoryne cordata var. cordata, which occurs in acidic, soft waters on the Malay Peninsula. The variety siamensis is very variable in size, leaf shape and colouration, and in aquarium culture there are different forms. For example, the large, broad-leaved \"Cryptocoryne blassii\" was popular decades ago as an undemanding aquarium plant, but has become rare in the hobby today.\nThe form we offer (Dennerle abbreviation C30) is smaller and narrower-leaved than the form \"blassii\". It has lanceolate, somewhat shiny leaves with an attractive dark line pattern and reddish-purple underside. Especially under intense light, the plant hardly grows taller than 10 cm for a long time, with a spreading habit. After a long time, especially in low light and with plenty of nutrients, it can grow over 20 cm tall. The petioles are then often longer than the leaf blades, which are about 7 - 8 cm long. Through underground runners, Cryptocoryne cordata var. siamensis can form a lush, dense stand over time.\nIn shallow water or in emersed culture, inflorescences with a long tube and yellow spathe blade may appear.\n\nThis slow-growing Cryptocoryne can be kept in soft to hard water. The Siamese water trumpet is particularly suitable for aquariums with fish and without added CO2, which are only dimly to moderately lit. However, it also thrives in intensive light and with added CO2. Nutrient supply via the substrate is very beneficial for its growth. The optimum temperature range for this tropical aquatic plant is between about 22 and 28 °C. Propagation is done by cutting off young plants that develop on the underground runners.\n\nThis relatively small form of Cryptocoryne cordata var. siamensis makes an interesting accent as a younger plant in the foreground to midground with its spreading, dark marbled leaves. Older, taller stands fit better in the middle to background. The Siamese water trumpet is versatile and also a suitable plant for tropical river biotope aquariums. In open, shallow tanks, you can count on its attractive inflorescences with yellow spatha.",
      "notes": "Cryptocoryne cordata var. blassii originates from swamplands in southern Thailand, Malaysia and on the island of Borneo. It is the most popular variety of C. cordata and very easy in cultivation.\n\nThis Cryptocoryne is an undemanding slow grower. It needs low to medium light (0.25-0.5 watts per litre), as its natural habitat is in shaded rivers. It does not require additional CO2, however, CO2 fertilisation may have a positive effect on growth. It can be kept in hard water very well. In order to reach its full height it needs a substrate rich in nutrients.\n\nThe emersed cultivation of C. cordata var. blassii is easy. It only needs low light and should be sprayed with water from time to time in order to increase the humidity. It also needs a nutrient-rich substrate when cultivated above the waterline.

      "description": "Description\n\nSomphong's water trumpet is a long known, well established and beautiful aquarium plant. Cryptocoryne crispatula var. balansae comes from calcareous rivers and streams in Thailand and some neighbouring countries. It is characterised by many flexible, long, ribbon-shaped leaves that are strongly hammered (bullate). This species is variable, there are forms with leaves up to 70 cm long and 4 cm wide. The most customary form has leaves up to over 40 cm long and about 1.5 to 2.5 cm wide. The colouring varies from olive green to reddish brown. Often the midrib and petioles are brown-pink. This Cryptocoryne forms a dense stand through underground runners over time. Fine roots often grow out of the substrate, which is normal for many Cryptocoryne species. The inflorescences have a conspicuous spirally twisted spathe and grow out of the water when the water level is low.\n\nThis narrow-leaved Cryptocoryne is robust and easy to care for. It grows at low to high carbonate hardness and pH values between about 6 and 8. The most favourable temperatures are between 20 and 28 °C. The light requirement is moderate. Addition of CO2 is not absolutely necessary, but promotes growth, as does nutrient supply via the substrate. Propagation is easy by cutting off young plants at the stolons in the soil.\n\nCryptocoryne crispatula var. balansae is very suitable for forming a dense stand in the aquarium background and also looks beautiful as a solitary bush in tall tanks. With its long and narrow-leaved growth habit, it is particularly well suited to aquariums with moving water that are designed to resemble a river biotope.",
      "notes": "Cryptocoryne crispatula var. balansae is found in rivers and rivulets in southern Thailand, where this variety of C. crispatula forms dense, mostly submersed populations with bandlike leaves floating in the current. When the water is low, some of these plants fall dry and then form flowers. The habitats of this Cryptocoryne are often found in areas with limestone rocks, so the water is hard and rich in calcium.\nC. crispatula var. balansae has been in the hobby for a long time, it is easy to cultivate and highly adaptable. It can grow to over 50 cm in height. There are different forms of var. balansae, one of the most common ones has leaves about 2 cm wide. However, leaf width can vary from 1.5 to 4 cm, and its colour may be anything between green and an attracive bronze hue.\nA typical characteristic of C. crispatula var. balansae are the bullous leaves with a hammered look.

It is often just called Cryptocoryne nurii in the trade, e.g. by Tropica, but differs from typical C. nurii. It was described in 2013 as Cryptocoryne nurii var. raubensis, named after the district of Raub in the Malaysian state of Pahang. In nature, this variety occurs in rivers and streams with sand and gravel over limestone, in the same area as the well-known Cryptocoryne affinis. The type variety, Cryptocoryne nurii var. nurii, on the other hand, originates from soft, acidic, low-lime waters, e.g. peat swamp forests, and is clearly more demanding in cultivation.\nThe ovate-lanceolate submerged leaves of C. nurii var. raubensis have a striking pattern: light, whitish to pinkish midrib and lateral veins on an olive green to reddish brown ground as well as dark transverse stripes. In cultivation there are several forms with slight differences; in 'Rosen Maiden' or 'Rozen Maiden' the longitudinal veins have stronger pink tones. The emersed leaves are usually broader ovate and rather inconspicuous green. The plant forms a flat, spreading rosette of leaves, about 20 - 30 cm wide and 10 cm high, as well as underground runners. Typical for var. raubensis are submerged inflorescences with an elongated stem (peduncle). In nature, this allows the spathe to reach the water surface and pollinating insects to reach the flowers on the spadix inside.\n\nCryptocoryne nurii var. raubensis has similarly low requirements as the proven water trumpets from the Sri Lanka group (C. wendtii, C. beckettii etc.). Cryptocorynes should, however, generally be placed in tanks that are already established and cycled, this applies especially to young plants from tissue culture. Nutrient-rich substrate or a substrate fertiliser is recommended. The plant still grows in low light, but unfolds its full splendour with at least moderate light intensity. Adding CO2 is not absolutely necessary, but can promote growth. The plant has no special demands on the water chemistry and grows at low to medium carbonate hardness. As with most Cryptocorynes, about 23 to 26 °C should be optimal. Growth is relatively slow. Propagation is easy by cutting off stolons or daughter rosettes at the base.\n\nCryptocoryne nurii var. raubensis 'Rosen Maiden' is still a rarity at the moment, but deserves wide distribution in the aquarium hobby. It is an eye-catcher with its special leaf pattern, especially as a group in the foreground to middle ground of aquariums.",

It has no special requirements and grows well in medium hard water, however a nutrient-rich substrate and at least moderate lighting are beneficial.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "Like so many other species from the Cryptocoryne wendtii group (= C. beckettii group), C. undulata has long been known in the hobby. In nature, it is found emersed and submersed along rivers and rivulets on the island of Sri Lanka.\n\nC. undulata is as easy in cultivation as the other species from the group of plants related to C. wendtii. This species grows even in unfertilised water and under low light, however, growth is very slow then, and the overall height of the plant increases. When planted in nutrient-rich substrate and provided with lots of light its growth rate increases, however, the plants will stay smaller as a whole. Under these conditions, the mother plant will form many runners, and the plant mass can grow substantially within just a few months. It is not necessary to fertilise this plant with CO2. Due to its compact growth, it should not be planted too densely.

So it provides a nice contrast to other foreground plants. </p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

It is only found in Mi Oya river on Sri Lanka, where the water is very warm. Tropia company was the first aquatic plant nursery to add this plant to their product range and to distribute it commercially. All in all, this species is a variety of C. wendtii that's not so very common in the hobby.\n\nThe cultivation of Cryptocoryne wendtii 'Mi Oya' is quite easy. A substrate rich in nutrients enhances growth. Light plays a decisive role in the growth habit of this variety. Lots of light results in a horizontal leaf position, whereas little light prompts C. wendtii 'Mi Oya' to grow vertically.\nAn addition of CO2 is not required.

Like most other Sri Lanka Cryptocorynes, it also grows well in hard water.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "This plant was brought into the hobby as Rotala sp. \"Araguaia\". Only recently (2010), after it was brought to bloom, Cavan Allen was able to identfiy the true species of this alleged Rotala species by comparing it with samples from the Smithsonian Herbarium (Washington, D.C.). The genus Cuphea holds around 260 species and is distributed in the American tropics and subtropics. Like Rotala, it belongs to the family of Lythraceae. Most species are terrestrial semi-shrubs, like the cigar plant (Cuphea ignea), which has long been in cultivation as an ornamental plant, and false heather (C. hyssopifolia). There are only a few aquatic Cuphea species, and C. anagalloidea is the first plant of the genus that is cultivated in aquaria. This species is endemic in Brazil, where it is distributed in the north, east, and south-east (Pará, Tocantins, Bahia, Goiás, Minas Gerais). (read more)\n\nMisapplied names\tRotala sp.

It grows best under lots of light (0.5 - 1 watt per litre). There is no need to fertilise with CO2, however, if CO2 is added it enhances growth significantly. This plant likes its water on the cooler side, thus a temperature of 26 °C should not be exceeded for optimal growth.

      "description": "Description\n\nThis compact, green, low-growing Echinodorus cultivar was developed by the plant breeder Christian Iversen from Aquartica company in Denmark. Under aquarium conditions, it forms a spreading rosette of broadly elliptic, medium green leaves with wavy margin. In stark contrast to the many vigorously growing, large swordplants, it is even suited for the foreground and for nano aquariums as it gets only 10-20 cm. Furthermore it grows quite slowly and contents with only moderate light intensity.\nThis plant is mostly delivered in its emersed (terrestrial) stage, with more roundish, longer stalked leaves.

      "description": "Description\n\n'Red Flame' is an especially decorative Echinodorus cultivar, selected by the famous breeder Hans Barth sen. (Dessau, Germany) in the 1990s. It reaches a moderate height of about 30 cm and develops a dense rosette of many leaves. Its underwater leaves have an about 10 cm long stalk and a 20 cm long, 10 cm wide blade. Especially the younger leaves show a contrasting pattern of densely set dark-red blotches on bright brown-red to light green ground. Also on older leaves, the spot pattern is still visible. The blotch pattern is stronger and denser than in the similar Echinodorus 'Ozelot'.\nAs most sword plants, this cultivar is mostly delivered by the nurseries in its terrestrial (emersed) form, with rather inconspicuous green leaves. Once planted in the aquarium, submerged leaves will appear, showing the full splendour of this plant.\n\nAs well as virtually all Echinodorus, 'Red Flame' grows best with abundant macro- and micronutrient supply via the substrate. Strong lighting with high red component enhances the intense coloration of the submerged foliage. The water parameters are of subordinate importance, however CO2 supply promotes the growth. Occasionally inflorescences may appear, developing adventitious plantlets.\n\nWith its bright coloration and striking pattern, Echinodorus 'Red Flame' is a realy eyecatcher in the aquarium. It provides a strong accent in the midground. With its relatively small size it is also suitable for the background of smaller, to about 30 cm high tanks.",

      "description": "Description\n\nEchinodorus decumbens is a very narrow-leaved wild type from Brazil. It was discovered by Christel Kasselmann at the Surubim river in eastern Brazil and also scientifically described by her. Until now this sword plant is only known from the original location. Since the 1990s it has been widely spread in cultivation, however it is not very familiar to the hobbyists and not often available in recent times.\nThis close relative of Echinodorus subalatus and E. palifolius develops in its submerged form very narrow, almost linear, freshly green, slightly transparent leaves and gets about 50 cm tall. It is named after the decumbent growth of its long inflorescences.\n\nAs virtually all Echinodorus, this species prefers a nutrient-rich substrate and medium to strong lighting. It has no special demands and grows also well in medium hard water. Due to its origin in a hot region of Brazil, Echinodorus decumbens tolerates high temperatures around 30 °C, so it's suitable for Discus tanks. Its growth is not very fast. It is propagated by adventitious plantlets on the inflorescences which appear mostly in the emersed form, but sometimes also in the aquarium.

Once imported into Germany, E. decumbens was cultivated and quickly spread in the hobby; today, it is frequently offered in trade.\n\nIts scientific name means \"low-lying sword plant\", which only refers to its decumbent, i.e. creeping flower stalks; the leaf rosette has an upright growth habit.\nE. decumbens is closely related to E. subalatus, and its emersed form differs from it - amongst other characteristics - by its decumbent (instead of upright) flower stalks, which grow distinctly larger than the leaves and whose flower whorls grow at larger distances.

The light requirement is moderate. For healthy growth, a good supply of nutrients, also via the substrate, and CO2 addition is recommended. The favourable temperature range is around 22-28 °C.

There are different plants under that name, however our plant is a small form that is already cultivated since the 1970's as Echinodorus opacus. Due to its low propagation rate it is still a rarity. Only recently the name addition \"Rataj\" is used to designate this small E. opacus form.\nVery different from the many big, fast-growing Echinodorus types, this plant grows slow and hardly flowers. It developes a creeping rhizome and hard, stiff, dark green leaves with ovate blade. It is particularly attractive through its light nervature that contrasts with the darker leaf tissue.\n\nEchinodorus opacus \"Rataj\" is not really demanding and is content with medium light intensity, however it benefits much from nutrient-rich substrate and CO2 supply. The temperatur may drop below 20 °C, corresponding to the subtropical climate in southern Brazil with already quite cool winters. With the growth of the rhizome, the leaf rosette shifts slowly on the ground. Long rhizomes can be cut into pieces for propagation. Side shoots will grow from buds on the rhizome parts.\n\nThis rare Echinodorus wild type is a special gem in aquariums, looking best as an adccent plant in the midground, in tall tanks also in the foreground.

      "notes": "The plant usually denominated Echinodorus schlueteri in Germany is not identical with the plant that was scientifically described in 1981 by Karel Rataj as E. schlueteri, but is presented in this database as Echinodorus maculatus.\nTrue E. schlueteri (sensu Rataj) is far less well-known. However, it is apparently identical with the plant sold as Echinodorus cordifolius 'Mini'. A systematic molecular examination proved that E. schlueteri is very probably a hybrid of E. maculatus and newly described Echinodorus reptilis from south-eastern South America (Lehtonen & Falck 2009). Therefore it is named Echinodorus × schlueteri by Lehtonen, marked as a hybrid by that.\n\nWhen cultivated submersed, E. schlueteri is a relatively low-growing plant with unicoloured light to medium green leaves.

During the warm season it grows well there, however, it is not reliably hardy in Central Europe.\n\nWaterweeds (Egeria, Elodea, Hydrilla, Lagarosiphon) are often mixed up.

Like this species, it is native to the southern part of South America (Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil), but its range stretches farther to the north, into the tropical zone of Brazil. This true submerged plant occurs in various flowing and standing waters. The plant has a more delicate appearance than Egeria densa; the leaves are narrower, with clearly visible teeth on the edges. The shoots are densely set with leaves and about 2-3 cm wide.\n\nThe Narrow-leaf Anacharis is an adaptable and fast-growing aquarium plant that should be well lit. Nutrient-rich water is very beneficial for its growth, CO2 supply is not always necessary. It can grow floating along the surface but can also be planted into the ground where it anchors itself with few long, unbranched roots. The optimum temperatures lie between 15 and 26 °C; also 30 °C are tolerated, at least temporarily. Egeria najas is more suitable for tropical aquariums than Egeria densa. As well as other stem plants it is easily multiplied by cuttings.\n\nThis Anacharis from the subtropics and tropics is versatile and especially recommendable for the initial planting of newly set-up tanks. It is also useful for breeding tanks because it produces a lot of oxygen, takes up excess nutrients from the water column and provides hiding places for the animals. Its deeply green, dense foliage is also decorative in variously planted, rather tall aquariums.",

The shoots are densely set with leaves and about 2-3 cm wide.</p>\n<p>The Narrow-leaf Anacharis is an adaptable and fast-growing aquarium plant that should be well lit. Nutrient-rich water is very beneficial for its growth, CO<sub>2</sub> supply is not always necessary. It can grow floating along the surface but can also be planted into the ground where it anchors itself with few long, unbranched roots. The optimum temperatures lie between 15 and 26 °C; also 30 °C are tolerated, at least temporarily. Egeria najas is more suitable for tropical aquariums than Egeria densa. As well as other stem plants it is easily multiplied by cuttings.</p>\n<p>This Anacharis from the subtropics and tropics is versatile and especially recommendable for the initial planting of newly set-up tanks. It is also useful for breeding tanks because it produces a lot of oxygen, takes up excess nutrients from the water column and provides hiding places for the animals. Its deeply green, dense foliage is also decorative in variously planted, rather tall aquariums.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

Whether it is really E. hydropiper should be verified by means of flowering and fruiting plants. Elatine hydropiper is widely distributed in Europe up to northern Scandinavia as well as in Siberia and Northern China. In Italy it only grows in the north-west. This species grows in and on ponds, rivers and marshes. The area of distribution reaches very far north, which makes it rather astonishing that the aquarium population of E. hydropiper grows so well in tropical tanks.\nIn the south of Italy and in other regions of the Mediterranean, two more species that look very much like E. hydropiper: Elatine macropoda, which is mentioned in old aquarium literature, and E.

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Needle spikerush or Hair grass is a classic aquarium plant and one of the most beautiful turf-forming plant species with its almost hair-thin, medium-green culms. It is native to Europe as well as Asia, North, Central and South America and, as an amphibious plant, colonises open, occasionally flooded fine sandy soils, e.g. on and in lakes and ponds, in swamps and wet ditches. Very thin underground runners develop into a dense turf, which grows to a height of around 2 to 10 cm in the terrestrial form and sometimes up to 30 cm in the submerged form. In the aquarium, the Needle spikerush usually grows to a height of around 10 to 20 cm, in contrast to Eleocharis pusilla or E. sp. \"Mini\" at around 5 to 10 cm.\n\nEleocharis acicularis is not overly demanding, but should be planted in a bright and unshaded place. The addition of CO2 is not a must, but, like a nutrient-rich substrate, it promotes the growth of the plant. Its delicate rhizomes and roots are best supported in a fine-grained substrate such as sand and aquasoil powder. The Needle spikerush tolerates a wide temperature range from near zero to (at least) 27 °C, with 20 - 25 °C being considered optimal. It is therefore suitable for cold water and moderately warm tropical aquariums. To achieve a larger lawn, divide the potted or in-vitro plant into a number of smaller clumps after removing the rockwool or tissue culture medium. These are placed in the substrate at a small distance from each other in the designated area. In a few weeks, the runners will grow together in the soil to form a closed lawn, and the denser the clumps are planted, the faster this will happen. Otherwise, the plant can be planted undivided and will then form more of a broad grass bush. The Hair grass can be kept relatively short by occasional pruning, but this Eleocharis species is recommended for a stand over 10 cm high. Propagation is easily achieved by dividing the plant.\n\nThe Needle spikerush is a versatile grass-like plant that is particularly recommended for cooler-temperature aquariums. While the dwarf hairgrasses (Eleocharis sp. \"Mini\" and E. pusilla) are particularly suitable for low lawns, Eleocharis acicularis is more suitable for a higher \"meadow\" or individual solitary tufts, also in combination with the other Eleocharis species. In emersed setups such as paludariums and Wabi-Kusa, a lawn of the Hair grass gives a natural impression; the emersed culms may then be adorned with small brown spikelets at the top.",

      "description": "Description\n\nThe dwarf hairgrass, also known as Eleocharis acicularis 'Mini', Eleocharis sp. \"Belem\" as well as the name Eleocharis pusilla, probably originates from the Belém area in Brazil. It stays lower than the Needle Spikerush, E. acicularis, and the plant that is traded as \"Eleocharis parvula\". It is one of the most popular lawn-forming plants in aquascaping. Although its culms may reach a length of about 10 cm, it is perfectly suited for an only 3-6 cm high, dense, lush, freshly green lawn. Its almost hair-thin, light green culms are typically arching and appear on many thin underground runners.\n\nEleocharis sp. 'Mini' is not very demanding but needs good lighting in the first place. CO2 addition and complete nutrient supply, also via the substrate, are very beneficial for its growth. For planting, the tissue culture or pot plant is split into smaller tufts that are distributed over the entire area to be covered. They are best put into the ground with tweezers. It grows together with its branched runners, eventually forming a dense lawn. Not before it has become very dense and too high, It should be trimmed to the ground. New culms will grow from the matted runners. The plant has to be cut down rather rarely.\n\nMagnificent look and low maintenance make Eleocharis sp. 'Mini' a great choice as ground-covering plant. As it also grows well emersed, it is also interesting for paludariums and Wabi-Kusa.",

It stays lower than the Needle Spikerush, E. acicularis, and  the plant that is traded as \"Eleocharis parvula\". It is one of the most popular lawn-forming plants in aquascaping. Although its culms may reach a length of about 10 cm, it is perfectly suited for an only 3-6 cm high, dense, lush, freshly green lawn. Its almost hair-thin, light green culms are typically arching and appear on many thin underground runners.</p>\n<p>Eleocharis sp. 'Mini' is not very demanding but  needs good lighting in the first place. CO<sub>2</sub> addition and complete nutrient supply, also via the substrate, are very beneficial for its growth. For planting, the tissue culture or pot plant is split into smaller tufts that are distributed over the entire area to be covered. They are best put into the ground with tweezers. It grows together with its branched runners, eventually forming a dense lawn. Not before it has become very dense and too high, It should be trimmed to the ground. New culms will grow from the matted runners. The plant has to be cut down rather rarely.</p>\n<p>Magnificent look and low maintenance make Eleocharis sp. 'Mini' a great choice as ground-covering plant. As it also grows well emersed, it is also interesting for paludariums and Wabi-Kusa.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nEriocaulon breviscapum has not been known as an aquarium plant for very long and is still a rarity. However, another plant is also available under the name \"E. breviscapum\", which is probably Eriocaulon periyarense. Our plant forms dense, grass-like bushes with submerged leaves that are 50–60 cm long and only 1.8 mm wide. The leaf rosette and roots sit on a 6-10 mm thick, ascending to upright rhizome. This forms daughter rosettes through branching, and over time a broad clump grows. Occasionally, inflorescences appear with a stem that remains shorter than the leaves and a head with many tiny grey-white flowers. With its narrow, flexible leaves, the plant resembles E. sp. \"Feather Duster\" and E. sp. \"Japan Needle Leaf\", but grows taller. Unlike \"Japan Needle Leaf\", it cannot attach itself to objects with its roots.\nEriocaulon breviscapum is endemic to the Western Ghats in south-west India, where it grows in shallow water in mountain rivers. It anchors itself in gravel and between boulders with its strong, long roots. Usually, only the inflorescences protrude from the water, while the long leaves float in the water.\n\nEriocaulon species have a reputation for being particularly demanding, but this is by no means the case with E. breviscapum.

However, another plant is also available under the name \"E. breviscapum\", which is probably Eriocaulon periyarense. Our plant forms dense, grass-like bushes with submerged leaves that are 50–60 cm long and only 1.8 mm wide. The leaf rosette and roots sit on a 6-10 mm thick, ascending to upright rhizome. This forms daughter rosettes through branching, and over time a broad clump grows. Occasionally, inflorescences appear with a stem that remains shorter than the leaves and a head with many tiny grey-white flowers. With its narrow, flexible leaves, the plant resembles E. sp. \"Feather Duster\" and E. sp. \"Japan Needle Leaf\", but grows taller. Unlike \"Japan Needle Leaf\", it cannot attach itself to objects with its roots. \n<br>Eriocaulon breviscapum is endemic to the Western Ghats in south-west India, where it grows in shallow water in mountain rivers. It anchors itself in gravel and between boulders with its strong, long roots. Usually, only the inflorescences protrude from the water, while the long leaves float in the water.</p>\n\n<p>Eriocaulon species have a reputation for being particularly demanding, but this is by no means the case with E. breviscapum. The species grows well in medium to strong lighting in soft to medium-hard water. A nutrient-rich substrate promotes growth, but is not absolutely necessary. Macro and micronutrient supply via the water column is sufficient. CO<sub>2</sub> supply is recommended if the aquarium has few animals.

      "description": "Description\n\nThis long- and narrow-leaved plant resembles Vallisneria nana but belongs to the \"chain swords\" of the genus Helanthium. It entered the aquarium hobby in Europe in the 1960s under the name Echinodorus angustifolius. Nowadays it is rather rarely available. It is an amphibious plant that's said to originate in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. When it falls dry, it develops its emersed stage with much shorter, lanceolate aerial leaves and inflorescences with white flowers. The light to medium green, strap-shaped underwater leaves get more than 50 cm long and about 3-4 mm wide. This rosette plant sprouts long runners with a chain of many young plants above the bottom. It is the wild type of the cultivar 'Vesuvius' that was selected in the nursery Oriental in Singapore.\n\nThe Narrow-leaf swordplant is a quite easy, fast growing aquarium plant. Medium lighting is sufficient, the favourable temperatures lie between 20 and 28 °C and the carbonate hardness may reach about 12 °KH. As well as other plants of the Alismataceae family, it benefits much from a nutrient-rich bottom. An adequate iron supply is important to prevent chlorosis (pale green new leaves). Favourable conditions lead to rampant growth of runners that can be cut off before they get out of hand.\n\nHelanthium bolivianum 'Angustifolius' looks decorative as a grass-like, freshly green stand in the background of an aquarium. The long leaves look especially well in tall tanks (more than 60 cm high). In lower aquariums they form long floating swathes beneath the surface. This classic aquarium plant is occasionally used for aquascapes in the Japanese nature aquarium style.",
      "notes": "Helanthium bolivianum \"Angustifolius\", better known under its former name Echinodorus angustifolius, originates probably from the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. Even though the plant grows quite high when submersed it is counted among the \"smaller\" sword plants forming runners, which have been placed in a genus of their own (Helanthium) different from the genus Echinodorus. Christel Kasselmann and Gitte Petersen identified H. bolivianum \"Angustifolius\" as a triploid form of Helanthium bolivianum (= Echinodorus bolivianus) by counting its chromosomes. In Europe, this Helanthium species has been known since the sixties of the last century, whereas it is still quite new to the hobby in the USA.

It entered the aquarium hobby in Europe in the 1960s under the name Echinodorus angustifolius. Nowadays it is rather rarely available. It is an amphibious plant that's said to originate in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. When it falls dry, it develops its emersed stage with much shorter, lanceolate aerial leaves and inflorescences with white flowers. The light to medium green, strap-shaped underwater leaves get more than 50 cm long and about 3-4 mm wide. This rosette plant sprouts long runners with a chain of many young plants above the bottom. It is the wild type of the cultivar 'Vesuvius' that was selected in the nursery Oriental in Singapore.</p>\n<p>The Narrow-leaf swordplant is a quite easy, fast growing aquarium plant. Medium lighting is sufficient, the favourable temperatures lie between 20 and 28 °C and the carbonate hardness may reach about 12 °KH. As well as other plants of the Alismataceae family, it benefits much from a nutrient-rich bottom. An adequate iron supply is important to prevent chlorosis (pale green new leaves). Favourable conditions lead to rampant growth of runners that can be cut off before they get out of hand.</p>\n<p>Helanthium bolivianum 'Angustifolius' looks decorative as a grass-like, freshly green stand in the background of an aquarium. The long leaves look especially well in tall tanks (more than 60 cm high). In lower aquariums they form long floating swathes beneath the surface. This classic aquarium plant is occasionally used for aquascapes in the Japanese nature aquarium style.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nIn the aquarium hobby, relatively small, turf-forming plants have long been known under various names such as Echinodorus quadricostatus, E. magdalenensis and E. xinguensis. These \"chain swords\" from the Helanthium bolivianum complex originate from tropical Central and South America. As amphibious plants, they colonise periodically flooded banks of rivers, lakes and ponds as well as swampy places. In the terrestrial form they have stalked, lanceolate leaves and small white flowers, in the submerged form they have narrower, almost grass-like leaves.\nThe plant we offer as Helanthium bolivianum \"quadricostatus\" has formed a turf about 10 - 13 cm high in our aquariums; Tropica states a growth height of 10 - 15+ cm. The light green, soft underwater leaves are linear-lanceolate and about 8 - 9 mm wide. It spreads rapidly by long chains of runners that creep along the ground, forming a lush, bright green turf.\n\nThis ground-covering plant does not require a lot of light, but at least medium light intensity is recommended, as is a good supply of macro and micronutrients. Iron deficiency can quickly lead to pale new leaves. CO2 supply is not always necessary, but is very beneficial for growth. The plant grows well in soft to medium-hard water. Temperatures between around 22 and 28 °C are ideal. The Helanthium species are comparable to the related Echinodorus species and cultivars in terms of their requirements. Individual rosettes of leaves are placed in the substrate at some distance from each other, where they then grow together with their runners to form a lawn. When the lawn has become very dense, it is advisable to thin out and cut off the runners so that the plants do not push each other up. Individual bushes or smaller groups are also possible if the runners are removed regularly.\n\nThe Chain sword can be used in a variety of ways as a taller, higher \"meadow\" or as a group in the foreground to midground of tropical aquariums. The bright green bushes create a lush impression and can also be combined with lower ground cover plants. With its fast growth and low requirements, Helanthium bolivianum \"Quadricostatus\" is recommended for the initial planting of newly established tanks and for aquarium beginners.",
      "notes": "The name \"Echinodorus quadricostatus\" is a trade name for various varieties of Helanthium bolivianum. In addition, it is also found under further denominations like Echinodorus magdalenensis (= E. quadricostatus var. magdalenensis), E. xinguensis (= E. quadricostatus var. xinguensis), E. bolivianus or \"Echinodorus grisebachii\" in the trade.\nOne of these forms only grows to under 5 cm in height when cultivated submersed, which makes it an ideal rapidly growing foreground ground cover.

These \"chain swords\" from the Helanthium bolivianum complex originate from tropical Central and South America. As amphibious plants, they colonise periodically flooded banks of rivers, lakes and ponds as well as swampy places. In the terrestrial form they have stalked, lanceolate leaves and small white flowers, in the submerged form they have narrower, almost grass-like leaves.\n<br> The plant we offer as Helanthium bolivianum \"quadricostatus\" has formed a turf about 10 - 13 cm high in our aquariums; Tropica states a growth height of 10 - 15+ cm. The light green, soft underwater leaves are linear-lanceolate and about 8 - 9 mm wide. It spreads rapidly by long chains of runners that creep along the ground, forming a lush, bright green turf.</p>\n\n<p>This ground-covering plant does not require a lot of light, but at least medium light intensity is recommended, as is a good supply of macro and micronutrients. Iron deficiency can quickly lead to pale new leaves. CO<sub>2</sub> supply is not always necessary, but is very beneficial for growth. The plant grows well in soft to medium-hard water. Temperatures between around 22 and 28 °C are ideal. The Helanthium species are comparable to the related Echinodorus species and cultivars in terms of their requirements. Individual rosettes of leaves are placed in the substrate at some distance from each other, where they then grow together with their runners to form a lawn. When the lawn has become very dense, it is advisable to thin out and cut off the runners so that the plants do not push each other up. Individual bushes or smaller groups are also possible if the runners are removed regularly.</p>\n\n<p>The Chain sword can be used in a variety of ways as a taller, higher \"meadow\" or as a group in the foreground to midground of tropical aquariums. The bright green bushes create a lush impression and can also be combined with lower ground cover plants. With its fast growth and low requirements, Helanthium bolivianum \"Quadricostatus\" is recommended for the initial planting of newly established tanks and for aquarium beginners.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

Under intensive light it tends to develop a creeping growth habit and thus can be used as foreground plant for strongly-lit tanks.

      "notes": "Baby tears, known as Hemianthus micranthemoides (or Micranthemum micranthemoides) in the hobby for decades, was discovered to be Hemianthus glomeratus by Cavan Allen in early 2011.\nTrue Hemianthus micranthemoides is another species that has probably never been in aquarium cultivation. The last herbarium record of this plant from nature is from the year 1941, and the plant is considered missing and possibly extinct today. Hemianthus micranthemoides used to occur on the Atlantic coast of the USA between the states of Virginia and New York in fluvial tidal zones.\n\nHemianthus glomeratus, however, is endemic to Florida, where it can still be found in large numbers in its natural habitats. It grows, amongst others, in wet depressions and stagnant waters. Its emersed form, growing on wet soil, forms a dense, low, light green carpet of tiny creeping shoots.

Although still quite widely spread in the North German Plain, its overall populations are receding. Featherfoil e.g. grows in shaded, muddy-peaty ditches or on the edges of oxbow lakes, forming dense submersed populations. Only its beautiful flower stalks reach above the waterline in May and June. If the location falls dry, the plant forms low-growing, matlike emersed populations. It is a known medicinal plant in natural medicine.

      "notes": "This small, delicate Hydrocotyle is highly popular with aquascapers especially from Asia, and is known under diverse names there. It was hardly known in Europe until recently. However, it was imported from Thailand to Italy in 2008 under the name Hydrocotyle sp. \"Japan\", and from Japan to Germany in 2010.\nIt is most similar to Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides, however, there are still some differences, the most prominent of them being the deeply indented three- to five-lobed leaves. Not only its nice leaf form that resembles somewhat of clover, but also the fact that it is more undemanding than Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides commonly available in trade. It is also a faster grower and has a more creeping or overhanging growth habit. Under lots of light and CO2 as well as an ample supply of nutrients it grows very fast and may even tend to get invasisve. (read more)\n\nSynonyms\tHydrocotyle sp. ''Australia'', Hydrocotyle sp.

It differs from the more wide-spread H. leucocephala by the form of its leaves that are formed like a tiny parasol and have no slot.\n\nCultivating H. verticillata in an aquarium is not really difficult. One of the most important factors is light, as its height depends on light intensity. The more intense, the smaller the plant will stay. Apart from that, its demands regarding nutrients and CO2 supply are quite easy to meet. A balanced supply of nutrients and CO2 injection are beneficial to the plant's growth, though. However, if abundant nutrients are added, unfortunately the dwarfism so many hobbyists covet in this plant will disappear and it will grow much larger leaves.\n\nA striking difference to H.

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Siamese temple plant is a large stem plant that has long been valued for its low demands. It is also labelled Hygrophila corymbosa \"Stricta\" by nurseries, but there are other H. corymbosa forms under this name.\nUnlike \"normal\", broad-leaved Hygrophila corymbosa, the underwater leaves of H. corymbosa ‘Siamensis’ are lanceolate. They can grow to around 16 cm long and 3.5 cm wide, with a coarsely wavy edge. The leaves are light to medium green on the upper side and light grey-green on the underside. In strong light, they can also take on a slightly bronze-coloured hue. The shoots can be up to around 25 cm wide under good conditions. The sturdy, 3 to 5 mm thick stem is densely covered with leaves and grows upright. Occasionally side shoots appear in the leaf axils. The shoots quickly grow to at least 40 cm long, and without pruning they eventually grow out of the water.

      "notes": "Hygrophila corymbosa 'Siamensis' is a very robust aquarium plant, easy to obtain as well as easy to cultivate. It is one of many varieties of Hygrophila corymbosa, a very variable species that is found in all of Southeast Asia.\n\nH. corymbosa 'Siamensis' can be kept in almost any aquarium, except in too small or too poorly lit a tank. It doesn't have high requirements regarding lighting and nutrient supply, and it tolerates a wide range of water hardness and temperatures. However, if the light intensity in relation to iron supply is too high it may develop symptoms of iron deficiency - green leaf nerves in yellowish leaf tissue. A lack of macronutrients may stunt its growth. Therefore one should make sure this plant, though hardy, is supplied with nutrients just like any other aquarium plant.\nWhen the nutrient supply is good and the light intense, H.

The plant is also well suited as a semi-emerged plant growing out of the water in open aquariums or as a taller marsh plant in paludariums.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "Hygrophila difformis is a very beautiful plant, and has been in cultivation in the aquarium hobby for many years. It originates from South and South-East Asia, where it grows in boggy areas. In Asia the plant is used in traditional medicine.\n\nThere are only few plants easier to cultivate in an aquarium than this one. It grows well under moderate light, however, more intensive lighting benefits its health and overall volume. Lots of light, CO2 injection and a good nutrient supply lead to enormous growth rates.\nThis makes it a great plant for newly set-up tanks, as it can absorb large amounts of nutrients, thus helping to keep ammonium levels down.\nIts pinnate leaves grow more refinedly under lots of light. Parameters like water hardness and the pH do not play an important role for H. difformis, and it also grows very fast in tanks with no CO2 injection.

      "description": "Description\n\nIt seems that this Hygrophila species is so far the only one in the aquarium hobby that is endemic to Africa - although this genus includes quite many exclusively African species. Hygrophila odora grows in wetlands of West Africa, e.g. on riversides.\nHygrophila odora shows a great difference between the emersed and submerged forms. In the emersed form, it is a strong marsh plant that grows to a height of almost one metre. The upright shoots have lanceolate leaves with entire margin and striking large blue-violet flowers in the upper leaf axils, which are somewhat reminiscent of sage (Salvia) flowers. The emersed stems and leaves are covered with sticky glandular hairs and have a strong odour, hence the species name H. odora.\nIn the submerged form, however, the plant is light green, hairless and has very decorative pinnately cut, narrow, almost fern-like leaves up to 10 cm long on tough stems. This Hygro species grows relatively slowly submerged and is well suited for moderately tall bushes in the aquarium midground.\n\nHygrophila odora is quite demanding with regard to the macro- and micronutrient supply. It is known to have a higher need for phosphate whose concentration in the water should not fall below 0,3 mg/l. Also CO2 supply and rather soft water with a carbonate hardness up to 6 °dH are recommended. The favourable temperatures lie between about 23 and 28 °C. Medium lighting is sufficient, however the plant must not be shaded. It is best planted in a group of single stems with a little space to each other. Occasional trimming of the shoot tips promotes more bushy growth. Hygrophila odora can be propagated by cuttings of the stem tips and side shoots, as well as other stem plants. Stems floating at the surface develop many side shoots that can be used for propagation. If you want to cultivate the plant emersed, rather strong lighting and a nutrient-rich substrate are recommended.\n\nThis rare African Hygrophila looks best as a group in the midground, in larger aquariums also in the foreground. With its pinnatisect, light green foliage, it gives a particular accent, and its relatively slow growth makes it easier to handle than Hygrophila difformis and H. balsamica with similar pinnate leaves. Hygrophila odora is also interesting as emersed plant for spacious paludariums where one may expect its pretty flowers.",

Medium lighting is sufficient, however the plant must not be shaded. It is best planted in a group of single stems with a little space to each other. Occasional trimming of the shoot tips promotes more bushy growth. Hygrophila odora can be propagated by cuttings of the stem tips and side shoots, as well as other stem plants. Stems floating at the surface develop many side shoots that can be used for propagation. If you want to cultivate the plant emersed, rather strong lighting and a nutrient-rich substrate are recommended.</p>\n\n<p>This rare African Hygrophila looks best as a group in the midground, in larger aquariums also in the foreground. With its pinnatisect, light green foliage, it gives a particular accent, and its relatively slow growth makes it easier to handle than Hygrophila difformis and H. balsamica with similar pinnate leaves. Hygrophila odora is also interesting as emersed plant for spacious paludariums where one may expect its pretty flowers.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "Hygrophila pinnatifida is an uncommon hygro endemic to India. There it grows on rivulets in the western coastal area on the foot of the Western Ghats (Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu), and in literature, findings of this plant are also documented for the north-Indian state Uttar Pradesh.\nH. pinnatifida has been known to science for over 150 years, however, it has only been cultivated as aquarium plant since early 2008. Up to now (2010) it is still relatively rare in the hobby, however, some large aquatic plant nurseries have already taken it into their product range as novelty.\n\nThis plant differs from the Hygrophila species hitherto kept in aquaria in many respects. Its leaves of the emersed as well as the submersed form are pinnatilobed to pinnatisect and are thus highly decorative.

Its shoots get about 5 - 8 cm wide and look best when they are kept in a height of about 20 - 40 cm. It is also known under the trade names 'Sunset' and 'Marmor' (i.e. Marble) and has a striking variegation with light nerves. But if you want deep-pink leaves you must provide intensive light. Otherwise the nerves are rather white.\n\n\nThe distinctive light colouring of the leaf nerves is probably caused by a virus which prevents chlorophyll from being produced in the cells around the leaf ribs, making them white. However, this virus does not affect other plants in the aquarium.\n\n'Rosanervig' or 'Sunset' is a very easy plant that also tolerates hard water and gets along without CO2 addition. However, its growth is strongly enhanced by good nutrient and CO2 supply together with at least moderate lighting. Regular trimming supports a bushy growth. The plant is easily propagated by cuttings of the head and sections of the shoot. Young plantlets also form at the breaking points of detached leaves that float around in the aquarium.\n\n\nOccasionally shoots may appear that have lost the white or pink pattern and are indistinguishable from standard Hygrophila polysperma. In order to retain the cultivar 'Rosanervig', these stems should be removed, and only shoots with the typical pattern of the leaves should be used for propagation.\n\nWith its striking white or pink leaf pattern, this Hygrophila attracts attention and is a versatile plant for bushes in the midground to background of aquariums.",

One special characteristic of this variety are the white-coloured leaf veins. They are not the symptom of a nutrient deficiency, though. It is assumed that a virus prevents the tissue around the veins from producing chlorophyll. This virus specialises in this variety only and thus poses no danger at all for the rest of the aquarium plants. This variety of the so well-known robust Asian H. polysperma has become a very highly coveted aquarium plant.\n\nThis undemanding red-coloured plant is very interesting as it is probably the easiest plant of that hue in cultivation.

However, this virus does not affect other plants in the aquarium.</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./bilder/kk_dropper_uploads/dt_Hygrophila_polysperma_Rosanervig_135.0260.00__beschreibungsfoto_klein.jpg\" data-large-image=\"./bilder/kk_dropper_uploads/dt_Hygrophila_polysperma_Rosanervig_135.0260.00__beschreibungsfoto_gross.jpg\" alt=\"Submers\"></p>\n<p>'Rosanervig' or 'Sunset' is a very easy plant that also tolerates hard water and gets along without CO<sub>2</sub> addition. However, its growth is strongly enhanced by good nutrient and CO<sub>2</sub> supply together with at least moderate lighting. Regular trimming supports a bushy growth. The plant is easily propagated by cuttings of the head and sections of the shoot. Young plantlets also form at the breaking points of detached leaves that float around in the aquarium.<br>\n</p>Occasionally shoots may appear that have lost the white or pink pattern and are indistinguishable from standard Hygrophila polysperma. In order to retain the cultivar 'Rosanervig', these stems should be removed, and only shoots with the typical pattern of the leaves should be used for propagation.\n<p>With its striking white or pink leaf pattern, this Hygrophila attracts attention and is a versatile plant for bushes in the midground to background of aquariums.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nThis Hygrophila was introduced to Germany in the 2010s by Dennerle from the Goa / Maharashtra region in western India. It is still a little-known rarity in the aquarium hobby. In the wild it occurs in swampy, more or less sunny floodplains. The plant has not yet been determined to species, but is probably related to Hygrophila ringens.\nIn the terrestrial form, this Hygrophila forms tall, strong, sparsely branched stems with fairly broad elliptical leaves. In the underwater form, the shoots also grow upright with few side shoots. The stem is about 4 mm thick and has internodes about 4 - 6 cm long. The underwater leaves are broadly oval to narrowly elliptical, at least 7 cm long and 1.8 cm wide. The leaf tip is rather blunt, the base of the leaf blade gradually narrows into the leaf stalk, which is about 1 cm long. The leaves have a dark olive-green hue and take on a brownish-red colour at the tip of the shoot in good light.\n\nThe plant is not very demanding and can be kept in soft to hard water with pH values of 5 to 8 and temperatures between around 22 and 28 °C, but a good supply of CO2 (20-30 mg/l) and a complete supply of macro and micronutrients are very beneficial for growth. Hygrophila sp. \"Green Olive\" grows quickly and reaches at least 50 cm in height. Timely pruning encourages branching and the cut shoots can be used as cuttings - as is generally the case with all stem plants.\n\nHygrophila sp. \"Green Olive\" looks most harmonious when planted as a group with a larger number of stems in the centre to background. It also grows well emersed in paludariums. Under favourable conditions, especially plenty of light and a good supply of nutrients, you can expect to see blue-purple coloured flowers in the leaf axils of emersed shoots.",

It is still a little-known rarity in the aquarium hobby. In the wild it occurs in swampy, more or less sunny floodplains. The plant has not yet been determined to species, but is probably related to Hygrophila ringens.<br>\nIn the terrestrial form, this Hygrophila forms tall, strong, sparsely branched stems with fairly broad elliptical leaves. In the underwater form, the shoots also grow upright with few side shoots. The stem is about 4 mm thick and has internodes about 4 - 6 cm long. The underwater leaves are broadly oval to narrowly elliptical, at least 7 cm long and 1.8 cm wide. The leaf tip is rather blunt, the base of the leaf blade gradually narrows into the leaf stalk, which is about 1 cm long. The leaves have a dark olive-green hue and take on a brownish-red colour at the tip of the shoot in good light.</p>\n\n<p>The plant is not very demanding and can be kept in soft to hard water with pH values of 5 to 8 and temperatures between around 22 and 28 °C, but a good supply of CO<sub>2</sub> (20-30 mg/l) and a complete supply of macro and micronutrients are very beneficial for growth. Hygrophila sp. \"Green Olive\" grows quickly and reaches at least 50 cm in height. Timely pruning encourages branching and the cut shoots can be used as cuttings - as is generally the case with all stem plants.</p>\n\n<p>Hygrophila sp. \"Green Olive\" looks most harmonious when planted as a group with a larger number of stems in the centre to background. It also grows well emersed in paludariums. Under favourable conditions, especially plenty of light and a good supply of nutrients, you can expect to see blue-purple coloured flowers in the leaf axils of emersed shoots.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

Only recently (in late 2009) it was identified as Hyptis lorentziana.\nIt has been imported from the Manaus area (Brazil), but is quite widely spread in South America (Venezuela to Uruguay and Argentine), and it is far more common in the southern parts of its area of distribution. It grown on the edges of ponds and other wet areas that are inundated regularly.

      "description": "Description\n\nThis relative of the Cryptocorynes has been in cultivation as a marsh plant for paludariums for a long time. It only became better known as an aquarium plant about 10 years ago. Lagenandra meeboldii originates from south-west India and colonises the swampy banks of shady streams there. It can grow both emersed and submerged. This Lagenandra species is very variable, with different forms. The form Lagenandra meeboldii 'Red' looks similar to a medium-sized, broad-leaved Cryptocoryne.\n\nLeaf structure and colouring of the submerged leaves\n\nThe colours of the leaves vary from olive green to light purple to reddish purple and this often in one leaf. The coarse, ovate, slightly heart-shaped leaves show variable colouring from olive green, orange-brown, light purple to reddish purple, often in the same leaf. Newly emerging leaves are light pink. The usually 6 - 12 cm long, 4 - 8 cm wide leaf blades can grow to a maximum of 15 cm long, with a stem up to 20 cm long. The plant grows relatively slowly under water, hardly getting higher than 10 cm for a long time, but has a spreading habit. Under good conditions, the leaf rosette reaches about 30 cm in height over time. Unlike cryptocorynes, this aroid does not form underground runners, but a creeping rhizome up to about 8 mm thick.\n\nThis Lagenandra is not a distinctly low-light plant like many Cryptocorynes, but should be at least moderately lit and have a free location. Plenty of light promotes the colouring of the leaves. The plant is a root feeder and grateful for a nutrient-rich substrate, as well as for CO2 addition. It also grows well at medium carbonate hardness. The most favourable temperatures for this tropical plant are between about 22 and 28 °C. For propagation, the rhizome can be cut into pieces a few centimetres long. Sometimes side shoots develop on the rhizome by themselves, which can be cut off.\n\nLagenandra meeboldii 'Red' works best as a solitary or small, loose group in the aquarium middle ground. As a younger plant, it can also be planted in the foreground. It is also very decorative as an emerse plant in paludariums, where you can also count on its striking inflorescences. These have a whitish outside, pinkish and felty spathe inside.",

A green and a red variety have been in emersed cultivation in botanical gardens and as paludarium plants by some hobbyists for quite some time.

As emersed plant, this tropical aroid should also be interesting for paludariums with high humidity where one may expect its interestingly shaped inflorescences.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "In aquaristics, the name Leptodictyum riparium (or Amblystegium riparium) is commonly used for the upright-growing \"stringy moss\". However, populations of L. riparium native to Germany have a very different appearance even when kept under the same conditions. They form - if they are not kept under very low light - more or less horizontal shoots with a dense, flat foliage. The growth habit of this moss corresponds to the descriptions of L. riparium in taxonomic literature (e.g. Frahm & Frey 1992) far better than that of the upright-growing \"stringy moss\". We are of the opinion that the popular \"stringy moss\" is Drepanocladus aduncus, not L. riparium.\n\nStreamside Leptodictyum moss, or Leptodictyum riparium, is distributed in almost all the world, and besides willow moss (Fontinalis antipyretica) it is probably the most common aquatic mmoss in Central Europe.

      "notes": "Limnobium laevigatum, Amazon frogbit, is a floating plant that looks a bit like a very large duckweed. It is native to lakes, ponds and slow-flowing rivers in all of Central and South America.\nCompared with the North American frogbit species Limnobium spongia, which is only rarely cultivated in aquaria these days, it is much more adaptable especially regarding temperature. Common frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), native to Europe and Western Asia, is hardy and thus a great pond plant. It hibernatives in the form of winter buds (turions), and, other than Limnobium laevigatum, it is possibly not apt to live in a tropical tank in the long run.\n\nThe growth habit of the Amazon frogbit is comparable to other floating plants. The floating rosette forms runners regularly, at whose ends young plants grow.

This pretty dwarf form of Limnophila aromatica is still not very common and hardly available in the trade, although it has been known in Europe for over a decade. It usually has two to three, sometimes up to six leaves per stem node, which develop light green to brown-red tones in the underwater form. Underwater, the stomata are visible as tiny silvery dots on the leaves. The leaf midribs and stems often remain light green, creating a striking contrast to the leaf surfaces. The narrow lanceolate leaves have a serrated edge and vary in size depending on the growing conditions. They are often only 1 to 2.5 cm long. However, we have found that this Limnophila also develops leaves around 3 - 5 cm long and 4 - 6 mm wide under intensive lighting and with an abundant supply of CO2 and nutrients. The stem is about 2 mm thick, the stem nodes are about 2 cm apart. The plant can grow to over 30 cm tall, but looks best as a group about 10 to 20 cm high.\nConfusingly, another plant is also on the market under the name Limnophila aromatica \"Mini\". We call this plant, which is also relatively small, Limnophila cf. hippuridoides ‘Mini’. It has 4 - 7, usually 5 leaves per stem node.\n\nLimnophila aromatica \"Mini\" develops most splendidly with high light intensity, the addition of CO2, a complete supply of macro and micronutrients and in rather soft water. The optimum temperature is between around 22 and 26 °C. The leaves remain light green in moderate light. Like other stem plants, it can be propagated by cuttings.\n\nThis small stem plant, still a rarity to date, stands out as a group in the foreground to midground with its brown-red and light green tones.

      "notes": "This small stem plant was first known as Limnophila sp. \"Mini\" and is also called L. sp. \"Kalimantan Mini\". It was taken for the species Limnophila repens, however, according to Kasselmann (2010), its flower characteristics match those of Limnophila aromatica. It is therefore a dwarf form of L. aromatica. We do not have reliable information about its origin, however the trading name \"Kalimantan Mini\" implies that the plant was probably found in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo island.\n\nConfusingly, there is also another small Limnophila form under the name L. aromatica \"Mini\", but that plant looks more similar to Limnophila hippuridoides and is provisionally called Limnophila cf. hippuridoides \"Mini\" by us.\n\nLimnophila aromatica \"Mini\" stays much smaller than other customary forms of L. aromatica.

      "description": "Description\n\nThis plant is a pretty selection of Lindernia rotundifolia with white longitudinal veins. With the parallel and arched veins, the variegated, roundish leaves are reminiscent of small striped balls. This plant is often only sold under the species name Lindernia rotundifolia, without the cultivar name 'Variegated'. On 1.5 to 2 cm thick stems are opposite, 1.5 - 2 cm long and 0.9 - 1.3 cm wide sessile leaves. The shoots are about 2.5 to 3.5 cm wide. The distance between the stem nodes (the internode length) is about 2.5 - 3.5 cm.\nThe parent form, the Round-leaf Lindernia, is a small amphibious plant in many tropical regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Central and South America. In the terrestrial form, the prostrate shoots form blue-white flowers and small capsule fruits with many seeds. When submerged in the aquarium, the growth of Lindernia rotundifolia depends on the conditions. In relatively low light, the shoots tend to grow strictly upright and branch little. Under intense light, they branch out quite strongly, forming a dense bush. The shoots can grow to a height of at least 40 cm, but tall, old bushes are often poorly rooted and can detach from the substrate. It is therefore advisable to keep the plant at a height of around 15 to 30 cm by pruning and replanting cuttings.\n\nLindernia rotundifolia 'Variegated' has the same low requirements as its green parent form. This fairly fast-growing stem plant tolerates temperatures below 20 to 30 °C, but around 22 - 26 °C is ideal. Soft to moderately hard water is suitable.

With the parallel and arched veins, the variegated, roundish leaves are reminiscent of small striped balls. This plant is often only sold under the species name Lindernia rotundifolia, without the cultivar name 'Variegated'. On 1.5 to 2 cm thick stems are opposite, 1.5 - 2 cm long and 0.9 - 1.3 cm wide sessile leaves. The shoots are about 2.5 to 3.5 cm wide. The distance between the stem nodes (the internode length) is about 2.5 - 3.5 cm.<br>\nThe parent form, the Round-leaf Lindernia, is a small amphibious plant in many tropical regions of the world: Africa, Asia, Central and South America. In the terrestrial form, the prostrate shoots form blue-white flowers and small capsule fruits with many seeds. When submerged in the aquarium, the growth of Lindernia rotundifolia depends on the conditions. In relatively low light, the shoots tend to grow strictly upright and branch little. Under intense light, they branch out quite strongly, forming a dense bush. The shoots can grow to a height of at least 40 cm, but tall, old bushes are often poorly rooted and can detach from the substrate. It is therefore advisable to keep the plant at a height of around 15 to 30 cm by pruning and replanting cuttings.</p>\n\n<p>Lindernia rotundifolia 'Variegated' has the same low requirements as its green parent form. This fairly fast-growing stem plant tolerates temperatures below 20 to 30 °C, but around 22 - 26 °C is ideal. Soft to moderately hard water is suitable. The light requirement is moderate, but as described, the more light the plant receives, the more branched and bushy it will grow. The addition of CO<sub>2</sub> is not absolutely necessary, but promotes growth greatly, as does a complete supply of macro and micronutrients via the water column, whereby the Round-leaved Lindernia also tolerates sub-optimal nutrient conditions.

Up to now, only Oriental Aquaria in Singapore is selling the true cultivar of this attractive small plant.\n\nLobelia cardinalis 'small form' is rather undemanding. Besides sufficient light (0.5 watts per liter) it only needs CO2 injection for optimal growth regarding size, colour and growth rate. A good supply of micro- and macronutrients should be assured, too (NO3 10-20 mg/l, PO4 1-2 mg/l).\n\nA good nutrient supply, the addition of CO2 and sufficient light result in a very bushy habit and nice green colour.

It has a bushy growth habit due to many side shoots.\n\nCultivation is not overly difficult, but this narrow-leaf Ludwigia looks best with stronger lighting, a good micro- and macronutrient supply and CO2 addition. Low nitrate levels together with relatively high phosphate levels enhance the reddish to orange-brown colour of the shoot tips. 22 to 26 °C are optimal, a temperature range of 12 to 28 °C is tolerated. Its growth is relatively fast, and occasional trimming supports its bushy growth.

Both plants can only be safely differentiated in their emersed flowering forms (please see description of Ludwigia arcuata).

      "description": "Description\n\nLudwigia glandulosa is one of the most colourful aquarium plants and is very different from many other aquarium Ludwigias. This species is a marsh plant from wetlands in south-eastern North America. It is often produced in aquatic plant nurseries under false names such as \"Ludwigia perennis\" or \"Ludwigia peruensis\". The strong shoots, which can grow to over 20 cm tall, usually grow upright under water and are hardly branched. In very strong light, they can also grow ascending, almost creeping, and then form many roots and side shoots at the base. The rigid stem is to over 3 mm thick. It is densely covered with lanceolate, 3 - 11 cm long, alternate leaves. Especially when there is a lot of light, the leaves are a strong wine-red colour, when there is less light they are more olive-green, but also have a wine-red underside.\n\nSubmerse Blattform der Ludwigia glandulosa\n\nIn the terrestrial form (emersed form), the plant can form long, woody, prostrate to erect shoots. These also form flowers and subsequently seed pods. The leaves on the flower shoots and also the flowers in the leaf axils are inconspicuous green.\n\nLudwigia glandulosa is more demanding than various other Ludwigias in the aquarium hobby and grows relatively slowly. Strong lighting, complete macro- and micronutrient supply via the water column as well as the substrate and CO2 addition are recommended. The temperature range is about 10 to 27 °C; 22 to 25 °C is optimal. It is best to plant a group of individual stems of different heights a few centimetres apart. Propagation is done by cuttings.\n\nLudwigia glandulosa is a real eye-catcher in the aquarium midground as a free-standing, solitary group of shoots of different lengths up to about 20 cm high and forms a strong colour accent. It contrasts with light green plants. This species from the warm-temperate southeastern USA is particularly interesting for cooler tempered aquariums.",

Despite its large distribution it is considered endangered to critically endangered in Indiana and Louisiana.\nIn the trade, it is often found under the erroneous name of \"Ludwigia perennis\", which is not a synonym for L. glandulosa but the name of another species found in Asia, Africa and Australia.

'Cuba') is a beautiful large stem plant, growing emersed as well as submersed in swampy areas on the \"Isle of Youth\", a small island off the south-western coast of Cuba. When cultivated above the waterline, its leaves are typical for an emersed Ludwigia, ovate and green, however, when cultivated submersed, its leaves grow out long, thin and show a marbled pattern with red and orange hues. Besides its unique appearance, this variety belongs to the species of Ludwigia inclinata, all of whose members form the same large yellow flower even though their geographical locations as well as their habit differ greatly. L. inclinata var. verticillata 'Cuba' was first introduced to the hobby by Tropica, not too long ago. (read more)\n\nCommon names\tCuban Ludwigia\nComplete botanical name\tLudwígia inclináta (L. f.)

      "notes": "The classical aquarium plant Ludwigia repens originates from the south of the United States, Central Americal and the Caribbean, where it grows on the edges of all kinds of waterbodies (ditches, rivers, lakes, ponds). It frequently forms dense trailing populations in the shallow water, whose shoot tips grow over the water surface. In nature, L. repens is a highly variable (polymorph) species and hybridises easily with other Ludwigia species, which makes scientific identification of the various local forms very difficult.\n\nLudwigia repens is among the most common aquarium plants world-wide. There are several forms of this species in trade. An especially colourful variety with round leaves is sold under the name \"Ludwigia mesakana\" or \"mesacana\". Allegedly, L. \"repens\" 'Rubin' is not to be counted among the species L. repens but is rather close to L.

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Dwarf waterclover, Marsilea crenata, is a pretty aquatic fern from tropical Asia and Australia that forms a small-leaved carpet in the aquarium. M. crenata is also sometimes regarded as a synonym of Marsilea minuta and is labelled as such by the company Tropica, for example. Like other Marsilea species, this fern grows in nature in various wetlands such as swamps, rice fields and floodplains. In the terrestrial form, long-stalked leaves with four leaflets grow on the creeping rhizomes, looking like \"lucky clover\". Marsilea crenata is usually sold in this emersed form.\nAfter some acclimatisation time, new shoots with much shorter submerged leaves grow in the aquarium, while the old emersed leaves slowly die off and can be cut off. The submerged leaves are usually undivided with small, rounded to spatulate leaf blades and are rarely more than 5 mm wide. They are significantly smaller than the submersed leaves of Marsilea hirsuta. Sometimes two-, three- or four-part leaves of different heights develop. Marsilea crenata spreads moderately quickly in the aquarium with its runners. The carpet grows to a height of about 1 - 3 cm.\n\nMarsilea crenata is a robust aquarium plant and can cope with relatively little light; the CO2 requirement is also low. However, the Dwarf waterclover develops best with at least moderate light and a complete supply of nutrients, including via the substrate, and the addition of CO2.\nAfter removing the rockwool, it is best to divide emersed potted plants into several pieces and place them in the substrate at some distance from each other. When rhizome shoots with submerged leaves develop, the old emersed leaves gradually die off and can be cut off. Tissue-cultured plants are also divided into several pieces and planted after washing off the culture medium.\nOver time, the rhizomes creeping in the soil or above ground grow together to form a carpet.

      "description": "Description\n\n\"Santarem Red\" is a particularly pretty Mayaca that has not yet been determined to species. The trade name probably refers to Santarém in the Brazilian state of Pará. This graceful, interestingly coloured stem plant probably first came onto the market in Japan. Until now it has been a rarity in the aquarium hobby and trade.\nThe shoots grow to more than 30 cm long, 2 cm wide and branch moderately. The limp but relatively tensile stem is whitish-green, about 0.5 - 0.8 mm thick and densely covered with alternate leaves. The gradually pointed leaves are very fine and delicate, about 1 cm long and less than half a millimetre wide. They have light olive-green to reddish tones and a red midrib. Typically, the leaves look somewhat \"wrinkled\". The shoot tips are pink. The plant can probably also develop a terrestrial form (emersed form) and should then flower, like other Mayaca species. Growth is moderate to fast.\n\nMayaca sp. \"Santarem Red\" is a moderately demanding aquarium plant. Its requirements are comparable to those of the long-known Mayaca fluviatilis: rather strong lighting, CO2 addition, rather soft water and regular macro- and micronutrient supply. It is best to plant tufts of a few shoots with little distance between them to form a group. Occasional pruning leads to bushier growth. Like all stem plants, this Mayaca is propagated by head cuttings and side shoots. We do not know the exact optimum temperature, but we recommend tropical temperatures between about 22 and 28 °C.\n\nWith its fine texture and light green, reddish to pink tones, the Santarém Mayaca attracts attention as an approximately 15 - 30 cm high bush in the aquarium middle ground. It is likely to look particularly interesting in combination with unusual plants such as Eriocaulon species. With its smallness and delicacy, this Mayaca is also well suited for nano tanks.",

The trade name probably refers to Santarém in the Brazilian state of Pará. This graceful, interestingly coloured stem plant probably first came onto the market in Japan. Until now it has been a rarity in the aquarium hobby and trade.<br>\nThe shoots grow to more than 30 cm long, 2 cm wide and branch moderately. The limp but relatively tensile stem is whitish-green, about 0.5 - 0.8 mm thick and densely covered with alternate leaves. The gradually pointed leaves are very fine and delicate, about 1 cm long and less than half a millimetre wide. They have light olive-green to reddish tones and a red midrib. Typically, the leaves look somewhat \"wrinkled\". The shoot tips are pink. The plant can probably also develop a terrestrial form (emersed form) and should then flower, like other Mayaca species. Growth is moderate to fast.</p>\n<p>Mayaca sp. \"Santarem Red\" is a moderately demanding aquarium plant. Its requirements are comparable to those of the long-known Mayaca fluviatilis: rather strong lighting, CO<sub>2</sub> addition, rather soft water and regular macro- and micronutrient supply. It is best to plant tufts of a few shoots with little distance between them to form a group. Occasional pruning leads to bushier growth. Like all stem plants, this Mayaca is propagated by head cuttings and side shoots. We do not know the exact optimum temperature, but we recommend tropical temperatures between about 22 and 28 °C.</p>\n<p>With its fine texture and light green, reddish to pink tones, the Santarém Mayaca attracts attention as an approximately 15 - 30 cm high bush in the aquarium middle ground. It is likely to look particularly interesting in combination with unusual plants such as Eriocaulon species. With its smallness and delicacy, this Mayaca is also well suited for nano tanks.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

It was discovered for the aquarium hobby around 2010 by Japanese and also South American aquarists. It was called Micranthemum sp. \"Montecarlo-3\" or \"Monte Carlo\" after a locality in the Argentinian province Misiones, as well as \"New Large Pearl Grass\" and \"Bacopita\". The plant has been identified as Micranthemum tweediei in the meantime. This Micranthemum occurs in Argentina, Uruguay and South Brazil, in wet places such as streambanks. It looks like a larger version of Hemianthus callitrichoides, growing flat on the ground, forming a compact mat, in the emersed and submerged form. Its roundish to elliptic leaves are a bit smaller and of a darker green than those of the similar Micranthemum umbrosum.\n\nMicranthemum tweediei is much easier to grow than Hemianthus callitrichoides. Coming from subtropical areas with already cool winters, it probably tolerates temperatures below 20 °C, but that still needs to be tested. For planting, it is best split into single shoots or small bushes that are put into the ground with a little space to each other. The shoots begin to creep over the ground, often also burying themselves into the substrate, eventually forming an entire mat that can get several centimeters thick. It should be trimmed back timely to prevent detaching from the ground. When planted in an elevated place, loose shoots will bow to the ground.\n\nThis plant from southern South America is a versatily ground cover that is not very light-demanding. It can even be placed on the hardscape where it grows hanging down. It is also interesting as emersed mat-forming plant for paludariums and Wabi-Kusa.",

This plant should also be interesting for well-lit emers set-ups in its cushion-like land form; you can then also expect its tiny flowers and fruit capsules.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nThis pretty, vigorous form of the Java fern (Microsorum pteropus, more recently also known as Leptochilus pteropus) became widespread in the aquarium hobby in the 2010s, but is still a rarity. Nothing is known for certain about its exact origin, it was possibly found in southern Thailand. Initially passed on under M. pteropus \"Orange\", it was later named M. pteropus \"Orange Narrow\".\nThis Java fern has a similar leaf shape and grows only slightly larger than Microsorum pteropus 'Narrow', but shows an interesting colouration. The tips and midrib of the young, sprouting leaves are coloured brown-orange or brown-red, as with the much larger and broad-leaved M. pteropus 'Red'. However, the leaves of 'Orange Narrow' are narrow-lanceolate and usually around 15 - 25, maximum 30 cm long and 1.8 - 3 cm wide. Older leaves take on a medium green, relatively light colour. The leaves are comparatively smooth, not as heavily hammered as some other Java ferns. The leaves are usually simple (undivided), but old, vigorous plants can occasionally develop one or two narrow lobes at the base of the leaf blade.\nA special feature of the Orange Java fern is that the relatively thin, long rhizomes tend to grow upright at an angle. This must be taken into account when using it as a perennial plant, as the rhizomes only partially creep horizontally on the substrate. However, excessively luxuriant upward growth can be counteracted by pruning the rhizomes.\n\nMicrosorum pteropus \"Orange Narrow\" does not differ from other Java fern varieties in terms of requirements. It is an easy plant that also grows in aquariums with low light and without additional CO2. However, the Orange Java fern develops best with a complete supply of macro and micronutrients via the water column, the addition of CO2 and at least moderate light intensity. A bright location promotes the reddish colouring of the young leaves. Like other Java ferns, M. pteropus 'Orange Narrow' can be attached to driftwood or rock as a perching plant. The fern can also be attached to the substrate, but the roots and rhizomes should not be buried, otherwise they could rot. As already mentioned, the rhizomes tend to grow upright at an angle. Pruning the rhizomes promotes their branching and thus a denser growth of the plant.\nAs is generally the case with Java ferns, \"Orange Narrow\" can also be propagated prolifically. You can divide the plant or cut the rhizome into several pieces with a few leaves. Young plants often develop on the underside of the leaves, especially on old and severed leaves.\n\nMicrosorum pteropus \"Orange Narrow\" is a rare form of Java fern with distinctive, bright brown-orange and fresh green colours. As a perching plant on wood or rock, the fern creates an interesting accent. With its moderate leaf size, it fits well in smaller tanks, but looks particularly impressive as a dense and lushly developed stand in large aquascapes.",

Its cultivation is very easy, it is a decorative plant and it is also readily available in trade.\nDuring the last years, increasingly more different forms of the originally quite large and broad-leaved Java fern have been imported. One of the most attractive forms is Microsorum pteropus 'Philippine'. Its relatively small, fresh green leaves are pronouncedly structured and have a \"hammered\" surface, which makes this a very attractive plant. In aquaristics, M. pteropus 'Philippine' was introduced by the Danish aquatic plant nursery Tropica.\n\nEven though the various Java fern varietys and cultivars look quite differently, their demands regarding water, fertiliser and light are more or less identical.

It grows not too slowly and develops many adventitious plantlets on older leaves. Moreover, it is easily propagated by splitting of the bushes. This fern doesn't need much light but grows best with at least medium lighting and complete macro and micronutrient supply. It can be tied to rock or wood or also fastened onto the ground. Its roots and rhizomes should not be planted into the substrate, otherwise they may rot.</p>\n<p>The Wavy Java fern is a versatile plant for the greening of the hardscape, suitable for almost every aquarium. Its bushes may even be used free-floating in breeding tanks. Together with Cryptocoryne cordata var. siamensis and Vesicularia cf. montagnei \"Krabi\" it would be a matching plant for biotope tanks that are inspired by the spring ponds near Krabi.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nMurdannia keisak is a new uncommon aquarium plant. It has narrow distichous leaves, and under water it has strictly upright stems with pronounced nodes, which remind somewhat of bamboo. The leaves grow to a length of up to approx. 5 cm and 1 cm in width, the stems are around 3 mm thick. This plant belongs to the Commelinaceae family, which means it is related to plants of the genus Tradescantia, the \"Golliwoog\" plant (Callisia repens), Cyanotis and Floscopa. Murdannia keisak is distributed in the warmer regions of Asia, where it mostly grows as bog plant or floats in shallow water. In the aquarium it does very well when cultivated submersed.

      "notes": "With its very narrow leaves growing in two lines Murdannia keisak looks very much like a grass, however, it truly belongs to the family of Commelinaceae, like the well-known houseplants of the genus Tradescantia or the \"Golliwoog\" plant (Callisia repens). Most of the 50 species in the genus Murdannia are terrestrial plants, like e.g. M. loriformis, which is used as a medicinal herb. Murdannia keisak is one of the few bog and aquatic plant species in that genus.\nM. keisak is widely distributed in the warmer regions of Asia, however, it has also been introduced into the south-east of the USA, probably with rice seeds. There it spreads continuously. It has also been introduced into Italy. This plant grows in a diversity of moist places, like road ditches, river banks and lakeshores, bogs and, first and foremost, rice paddies.

It has narrow distichous leaves, and under water it has strictly upright stems with pronounced nodes, which remind somewhat of bamboo. The leaves grow to a length of up to approx. 5 cm and 1 cm in width, the stems are around 3 mm thick. This plant belongs to the Commelinaceae family, which means it is related to plants of the genus Tradescantia, the \"Golliwoog\" plant (Callisia repens), Cyanotis and Floscopa. Murdannia keisak is distributed in the warmer regions of Asia, where it mostly grows as bog plant or floats in shallow water. In the aquarium it does very well when cultivated submersed. In the submersed form, the leaves are of a very light green, often with some purple hues. When nutrients are deficient, the leaves tend to assume a whitish colour.

In 1994, red milfoil was correctly identified as M. tuberculatum by A.E. Orchard.\nTrue M. mattogrossense is all green, and was first imported from Eduador by Christel Kasselmann in 1990. Its popularity has been growing ever since due to its beauty and easy cultivation. It is relatively often found in trade now.\n\nThis milfoil is one of the easier-to-cultivate plants.

As a fast-growing plant, it can be recommended for the initial planting of newly set-up aquariums.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

However, in 1994 it was identified as M. tuberculatum by botanist A. E. Orchard - after true, green M. mattogrossense had been imported from Ecuador by Christel Kasselmann in 1990.\n\nM. tuberculatum is rather difficult in cultivation. It needs intensive light with at least 0.8 watts per litre, and CO2 injection is indispensable.

It is popular as an ornamental pond plant in warm countries. Nymphaea rubra is often mistakenly sold as Nymphaea stellata and is sometimes included in N. pubescens. It is closely related to Nymphaea lotus from Africa and, like the latter, is a night bloomer. Its splendid, approx. 9 - 15 cm wide flowers, which open in the evening and close in the morning to mid-morning, are not white, however, but pinkish red to purplish red. Nymphaea rubra is often called ‘Dwarf Water Lily’ in the aquarium trade, but this is a misnomer. The submerged plant grows to a height of at least 30 cm. The underwater leaves have at least 20 cm long brown-red blades with a few small dark red spots. The petioles of the submerged leaves are up to about 20 cm long. Vigorous plants soon develop floating leaves with 30 to 70 cm long petioles. The round floating leaves are dark red when they emerge, later turning olive green and have blades about 20 - 40 cm long (usually smaller in aquariums). The margin of the floating leaves is more or less toothed. The rhizome is a tuber.\n\nLike the Tiger lotus (Nymphaea lotus), Nymphaea rubra is not very demanding, but should be planted in a free, bright spot. It is suitable as a solitary plant for large aquariums. Narrow arrow-shaped, later broad heart-shaped underwater leaves sprout from the tuber. Temperatures between about 20 and 30 °C are recommended. Nutrient-rich substrate is very conducive, but overly lush plants can quickly develop long-stalked floating leaves that shade the aquarium considerably.

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Colombian water fringe was only introduced to Europe a few years ago. It soon turned out to be a magnificent aquarium plant that is comparatively easy to care for. However, it is still a little-known rarity in the aquarium hobby. Nymphoides flaccida has so far only been found in the Departamento Meta in the Llanos region of Colombia. It grows there in fast-flowing streams with a gravel and boulder substrate. Unlike many other Nymphoides species, the underwater leaves of N. flaccida are not waterlily-like and roundish, but elongated, almost ribbon-shaped. They have approx. 10 - 12 cm long blades on approx. 12 to over 25 cm long petioles. With its leaf shape, this aquatic plant is vaguely reminiscent of the tropical seaweed Caulerpa prolifera. The species name flaccida ( = limp) refers to the soft texture of the leaves. The fresh, light green, loose leaf rosettes grow to a height of around 20 to 40 cm in our aquaria and have a short, thin rhizome.\nNymphoides flaccida shares a special way of propagation with other Nymphoides species: a young plant (adventitious plant) with roots apparently sprouts laterally from the leaf stalk about 1 cm below the leaf blade. In fact, these are not long-stalked leaves, but independent side shoots with a bud and a short-stalked leaf at the end. If such a shoot floats on the surface of the water, flowers can sprout from the bud before the adventitious plant appears. If the shoot remains under water, only the adventitious plant will develop. The delicate, white flowers with five narrow, finely fringed petals give the plant an additional decorative touch.\n\nThis particular species of Water snowflake makes no special demands on care and grows moderately quickly. Nevertheless, we recommend soft to medium-hard water, the addition of CO2 and moderate to strong lighting. Temperatures of around 22 - 28 °C are favourable. A complete supply of macro and micronutrients via the substrate and/or the water column ensures good growth, but in our experience Nymphoides flaccida is not very sensitive to low nutrient levels. Propagation is by the aforementioned adventitious plantlets on long shoots. As soon as a young plant has sprouted a few leaves and roots, the stem can be cut off just below the sprouting point and the young plant together with the stem piece can be planted in the ground. Older plants sometimes only form long shoots with young plants and then no longer look very decorative. You can then cut off all the shoots, after which new leaves will sprout, or you can replace the plant with one of the abundantly formed young plants.\n\nThe still rare and little-known Nymphoides flaccida is a highly recommended, versatile aquarium plant with a remarkable appearance. With its moderate growth height, it is suitable for the background of smaller tanks, and in aquariums over 40 cm high also for the middle ground. It can be used as a solitary plant, but with its loose rosettes of leaves it also looks beautiful as a larger stand of many plants. The Colombian water fringe is particularly interesting for stream biotope aquariums. In relatively low aquariums without a cover, its delicate white flowers on the surface of the water create a pretty accent.",

In the terrestrial form the leaves are rather green in colour.\n\nLike other Persicaria species, \"Kawagoeanum\" prefers a lot of light and above all a good macro- and micronutrient supply, also via the substrate. The addition of CO2 is beneficial. The shoots grow upright and branch moderately. The head shoots look most beautiful. Stems that have become long tend to become bare at the bottom and form many water roots. Shoots that have been cut back often only sprout weakly. If the shoots have become unsightly, they should be removed and the shoot tips replanted as cuttings.\nIf you do not cut back the shoots, they will grow out of the water and come into flower. The emersed culture is easy on moist, nutrient-rich soil. The older shoot sections lay down and take root at the nodes.\n\nPersicaria sp. \"Kawagoeanum\" works best in the aquarium as a solitary group, no more than 30 - 40 cm high, in the middle ground, and with its beautiful light orange-red tones it forms a colour accent that contrasts especially with light green plants. As an emersed, flowering plant in open tanks, paludariums and wabi kusa, this knotweed forms a \"scrub\" with its own wild charm.",
      "notes": "Persicaria (or Polygonum) sp. 'Kawagoeanum' (sometimes also called Polygonum sp. 'Pink') is a relatively new aquarium plant. It is still not quite clear which species it belongs to, it could be Persicaria kawagoeana (= Polygonum kawagoeanum) from East Asia, though. Like most knotweeds, it inhabits wet locations like bogs, ditches or riverbanks. It grows above as well as below the waterline.\nAccordingly, Persicaria sp. 'Kawagoeanum' can be cultivated emersed as well as submersed. It is not regularly found in pet stores or online shops, and is usually more readily available from other hobbyists.\n\nP. sp. 'Kawagoeanum' is often mistaken for Persicaria (Polygonum) sp. 'Sao Paulo', and it has been in trade under that erroneous name, too.\nFor differentiation, please see the description of Persicaria sp.

This aquatic knotweed from Brazil has not yet been identified to species, but we suspect that it belongs to Persicaria hydropiperoides, a wetland plant that is widespread from North to South America. Persicaria sp. \"Sao Paulo\" takes on an intense magenta colour when well lit and supplied with nutrients under water. The stem grows strictly upright. If left alone, the plant will eventually grow out of the water and flower.\nIn the terrestrial form (emersed), shoots of Persicaria sp. \"Sao Paulo\" tend to have dark to medium green leaves. Under water, however, the plant soon develops shoots with red-coloured leaves. The stems branch out at the nodes and can grow to at least 50 cm long. However, the plant looks better in the aquarium if it is not allowed to grow much taller than around 30 - 40 cm.\nAquatic plant nurseries often supply Persicaria sp.

The addition of CO2 is recommended. Rather strong lighting promotes the splendid colouring of this plant. It is best to plant stems individually in a group with some distance between them. Like other stem plants, Persicaria sp. \"Sao Paulo\" can be propagated by terminal and partial cuttings. Stems that have become very long tend to become bare (shed lower leaves) and form many water roots at the nodes. If they are cut back severely, the remaining stems often sprout poorly again.

      "description": "Description\n\nPogostemon deccanensis, the Indian star plant, differs very much from the standard Pogostemon species in the aquarium hobby. This plant was originally imported under the erroneous name Rotala verticillaris, and later on identified as Pogostemon erectus. It is still generally known under the name P. erectus today. However, the plant has since turned out to be the closely related species Pogostemon deccanensis. We go into this in detail in this Wiki article.\n\nSubmerged leaf shape of Pogostemon deccanensis\n\nThe light green needle-like narrow leaves grow densely on the stems. The plant is especially beautiful when planted in dense groups in the middle or background. When provided with good light (at least 0.5 W/litre), the addition of CO2 and regular fertilisation, this Pogostemon is not especially difficult in cultivation. When cultivated emerged, beautiful candle-like flower spikes with a characteristic smell will form when the plant gets sufficient light.",
      "notes": "Pogostemon erectus was originally collected for aquaristical purposes in the western Indian state Maharashtra, and it was presented under the erronous name \"Rotala verticillaris\". During the last years it has been used in many aquaria - mainly in the USA, but increasingly in Europe, too. At first glance, it looks a lot like Rotala verticillaris and some varieties of R. mexicana, however, its submersed growth differs from both by its more strictly upright growth habit and overall larger dimensions. Its emersed form makes the differences even clearer: whereas R. verticillaris and R. mexicana, both belonging to the Lythraceae family, have rather inconspicuous flowers sitting in the leaf axils, Pogostemon erectus, of the Lamiaceae family, shows highly distinct, decorative flower spikes with violet flowers, quite similar to those of the other Pogostemon species known.

Within only a short period, P. helferi has become a very popular aquarium plant for the fore- and middleground.\nThese authors found the species on a fast-flowing river with limestone ground. The plants grow on and between rocks, submersed for most of the rainy season in summer, and often in a strong current. During autumn and winter, the populations of P. helferi fall dry and form upright shoots with striking flower spikes typical for the genus Pogostemon.\n\nThis Pogostemon species is easy in cultivation, given that specific requirements are met: sufficient light (0.

One of the narrow-leaf forms is partly labeled as P. stellatus \"Strong\" but has the same fine submerged foliage as other \"normal\" P. stellatus.\nThe Water star is mostly delivered in its emersed (terrestrial) form, with green leaves. Planted into the aquarium, it unfolds its whole splendour, growing new shoots with very narrow, light green to reddish purple leaves in whorls. The shoots get more than 10 cm in diameter and are branched.\n\nPogostemon stellatus needs rather strong light, addition of CO2 and a good nutrient supply. Micronutrient deficiencies may lead to pale leaves. The plant is a good indicator for the nutrient situation in the tank. Pogostemon stellatus prefers higher temperatures (approx. 24-28 °C) and soft to medium-hard water. Growth may stagnate from time to time even though the conditions are good. It is easily propagated by cuttings.\n\nPogostemon stellatus looks most magnificent as a group or large bush in the midground to background of large aquariums. Occasional trimming promotes bushy growth. The plant is also suited as emersed plant for well-lit paludariums and Wabi-Kusa, however its emersed green leaves are rather inconspicuous. One can expect its pretty purple flower spikes under short day conditions (coherent dark phase of more than 12 hours per day).",

The shoots get more than 10 cm in diameter and are branched.</p>\n<p>Pogostemon stellatus needs rather strong light, addition of CO<sub>2</sub> and a good nutrient supply. Micronutrient deficiencies may lead to pale leaves. The plant is a good indicator for the nutrient situation in the tank. Pogostemon stellatus prefers higher temperatures (approx. 24-28 °C) and soft to medium-hard water. Growth may stagnate from time to time even though the conditions are good. It is easily propagated by cuttings.</p>\n<p>Pogostemon stellatus looks most magnificent as a group or large bush in the midground to background of large aquariums. Occasional trimming promotes bushy growth. The plant is also suited as emersed plant for well-lit paludariums and Wabi-Kusa, however its emersed green leaves are rather inconspicuous. One can expect its pretty purple flower spikes under short day conditions (coherent dark phase of more than 12 hours per day).</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

In Northern Australia, a very similar broad-leaved Pogostemon variety is found, which has been imported to Europe under the name \"Adelaide River\".

      "description": "Description\n\nRanalisma rostratum is a small plant from the water-plantain (Alismataceae) family and is native to tropical Asia. Although this plant became known in aquaristics a long time ago, it has remained a rarity in the trade. The species name is also spelled Ranalisma rostrata. In old aquarium literature this species is found under the synonym Echinodorus ridleyi. The genus Ranalisma contains only two species, the second species is Ranalisma humile from Africa.\nThis plant is one of the most beautiful grass-like ground covers. One hardly suspects this when it comes into the trade in its terrestrial form, for it then has rounded, spoon-like leaves and small white flowers from which conspicuous hedgehog-like aggregate fruits develop. Under water, however, Ranalisma rostratum develops light green, narrow, grass-like leaves and forms a bright green, low, about 4 to 6 cm high lawn through runner chains, very similar to Helanthium tenellum 'parvulum'. The submerged leaves are usually about 5 - 8 cm long and 2 - 3 mm wide.\n\nPay attention to rather strong lighting and good CO2 and nutrient supply. Iron deficiency is quickly indicated by pale yellow new leaves. Like all rosette plants, Ranalisma rostratum is grateful for a nutrient-rich substrate, e.g. Aquasoil. In our experience, the plant is somewhat more demanding than Helanthium tenellum \"parvulum\", but also remains lower and narrower-leaved than the latter. It is best to place several individual plants in the substrate at some distance from each other. With their runners they will soon grow together to form a lawn. Too dense stands should be thinned out; too many new runners can simply be cut off.\n\nRanalisma rostratum deserves more attention in aquascaping as a light green, grass-like ground cover. In \"geographically correct\" Asia-themed tanks, this plant is a substitute for the similar chain swords (Helanthium) originating from America. In the land form, Ranalisma rostratum should be interesting for emers set-ups such as aquaterrariums and wabi-kusa.",
      "notes": "Ranalisma rostratum is a small plant from the Asian tropics and subtropics. It is often sold under the grammatically incorrect name \"Ranalisma rostrata\". When kept emersed, the leaves of R. rostratum are roundish, with a stalk, and the short inflorescence often consists of a single flower, from which a rather large erinaceous aggregate fruit develops. It contains a large number of rostrate nutlets with flat sides. The submersed form has light green lineal leaves and closely resembles the light green variety of Helanthium tenellum (please see Helanthium tenellum \"parvulum\"). Just like the species of the genus Helanthium, R. rostratum forms long runners that are truly modified inflorescences (pseudo or inflorescence stolons).\n\nR.

Riccardia sp. \"graeffei\" attaches itself by rhizoids, like other Riccia species; it can be tied or glued to rock or wood, or simply squeezed into crevices of the hardscape. This liverwort is very brittle, but each small piece will grow. Old, big cushions should be trimmed in good time, otherwise they may become detached from the substrate.</p>\n<p>This filigree liverwort is among the most attractive epiphytes for the hardscape.

      "notes": "Riccia fluitans aka crystalwort is a floating plant found in all the world. It was scientifically described and catalogised as early as 1753 by Linnaeus, however, Takashi Amano from Japan was the first to keep it submersed in his nature aquaria, using it as an epiphyte by tying it to wood and rocks with a thin fishing line. Thus, Riccia became one of the most favourite plants of plant aquaristis. Meanwhile it has found its way into most plant dealers' product catalogues. There are four different varieties (originating from Japan, Europe, Thailand and Singapore), however, only the variety from Japan is suitable for submersed cultivation.\n\nRiccia fluitans is easy to cultivate. Its wide distribution may be attributed to the fact that it tolerates a multitude of different environmental conditions, e.g. (read more)\n\nCommon names\tCrystalwort, Floating liverwort\nComplete botanical name\tRíccia flúitans L.\nFamily\tRicciaceae\nGenus\tRiccia\nDifficulty\tmedium\nUsage\tPlant for spawning, Nano tanks, Water surface\nAquascaping\tfine-leaved\nGrowth\tfast\npH value\t5 - 7\nTemperature tolerance\t4 - 30°C\nCarbonate hardness\t0 - 21°dKH\nGeneral hardness\t0 - 30°dGH\nPropagation\tFragmentation, Splitting, cutting off daughter plants\nCan grow emersed?\tyes\nSource\tFlowgrow",

      "description": "Description\n\nTrue Rotala indica is not very well-known as aquarium plant. At the moment is it labeled as Ammania sp. \"Bonsai\" and Rotala sp. \"Bonsai\" as the trade names, but its flowers have helped identify it correctly as R. indica. The name Rotala indica has been known in the aquarium hobby for a long time, but it was erroneously used for the totally different species Rotala rotundifolia. The unique appearance of Rotala indica can best be described as compact miniature version of Bacopa caroliniana. R. indica is a slow grower; under a lot of light, the shoot tips and stems turn reddish. With its straight hardly ramified thick stems and its roundish leaves it is best planted in a group in the fore- or middle ground of a tank. Rotala indica is especially suitable for smaller aquaria, but a large group of this plant may look nice in a bigger tank, too. Good lighting (at least 0.5 W/litre) and an ample supply of CO2 and nutrients need to be made sure. Moreover, R. indica should not be planted in the shade.",
      "notes": "There is quite a bit of confusion around the name Rotala indica in aquaristics. The reason for this is, that in 1960, Rotala rotundifolia was imported under the erroneous name \"Rotala indica\". Even today, especially reddish forms of the very variable R. rotundifolia are sold as \"Rotala indica\" in trade.\nTrue R. indica, however, is a competely different species that does not play a very important role as aquarium plant. Only recently, the plant sold as \"Ammannia sp. 'Bonsai' \" has been identified as true Rotala indica. It was also confused with Lindernia sp. \"India\".\nRotala indica is widely spread in the warmer regions of Asia and is very often found as annual weed in rice paddies. It has been introduced into other regions of the earth where rice is cultivated, e.g. in Northern Italy.\n\nThe emersed as well as the submersed forms of R. indica differ distinctly from R.

      "notes": "Rotala macrandra 'Green' is a relatively small variety of R. macrandra and quite obviously identical with the plant that has recently gained popularity under the name R. macrandra \"Wavy\" in Germany.\n\nA stunning characteristic of this plant is that it looks very different depending on the conditions it grows in. Moderate light leads to its \"typical\" habit with longish, rather light green leaves and reddish stems. The leaf margins are then distinctly sawed, the leaf tip is obtuse.\nUnder more intensive light, though, the leaves attain a reddish hue, and shoots may form whose leaf forms vary from ovate to round with a smooth margin. This modification is quite stable and could easily lead the layman to the conclusion that this plant belongs to an entirely different variety.\n\nThe emersed form has round green leaves on red stems, like the \"standard\" land form of Rotala macrandra.

Under water, Rotala macrandra 'Variegated' develops wavy, delicate, elongated, egg-shaped leaves about 2 to 4 cm long on upright stems.

Rather strong lighting, soft to medium-hard water, the addition of CO2 and a balanced supply of macro and micronutrients are important. This tropical plant is quite thermophilic, with optimum temperatures of 24 to 28 °C.

The midrib and leaf base are a contrasting light green colour, and the stems are also green. The shoots are about 4 - 5 cm wide, the leaves 2.5 - 3 cm long and 4.5 mm wide. The stem is about 2 mm wide and densely covered with leaves. The stem nodes are 4 - 5 mm apart.\nIn addition to \"Sunset\", there are other R. ramosior forms such as \"Florida\" and a larger, green form from Virginia. \"Florida\" differs from \"Sunset\" in its strong red-violet tones, smaller, elliptical leaves and thinner stems; the plant also grows somewhat more slowly. In Rotala ramosior \"Sunset\", the more elongated leaves are more upright at the tip and more bent over further down the stem.\n\nRotala ramosior \"Sunset\" has only a moderate growth rate. In our aquaria it has grown to a height of around 10 - 11 cm in one month. It is a demanding, light-loving plant; constant CO2 and macro- and micronutrient supply are recommended. Also fertilisation via the substrate is helpful. Especially young plantlets from tissue culture should only be planted in already cycled, well-running aquariums. As well as other stem plants, this Rotala can be propagated by cuttings. However this has to be done carefully. Rotala ramosior \"Sunset\" does not well tolerate hard cutting, and its propagation rate is rather low. When the remaining stumps of the stems are too short, they often rather die instead of developing side shoots. It is best to let the plants grow untouched for some time, then terminal cuttings can be made further up. When the stumps are vital enough, they will grow some side shoots that can be used for propagation again. In this way, by selective, careful trimming and replanting of cuttings, a group of the plant can be grown.\n\nRotala ramosior \"Sunset\" is a special gem in the aquarium with its straight, densely leafed shoots and its colour contrast between brown and purple-red leaves and green stems. With its colour tones, this Rotala has an appropriately chosen trade name. The plant looks best as a free-standing group in the midground that is not much taller than 20 cm.",

      "notes": "Rotala rotundifolia is a classical aquarium plant, distributed from South over South-East to East Asia, where it is found in swamps, on riversides and in ricefields from the lowlands to a height of 2700 metres above sea level. Rice seeds imported into the Southern US were contaminated with Rotala seeds. Now this plant is also widely distributed there, too.\nAs aquarium plant, R. rotundifolia was first introduced under the erroneous name of Rotala indica around the year 1960, a confusion lasting to this date and creating possible mistakes, as the true Rotala indica (which differs considerably from Rotala rotundifolia) was also introduced to the hobby several years ago. The latter, however, was first imported under the trade name \"Ammannia sp. 'Bonsai'\", and, even earlier, due to a mix-up, mistakenly as \"Lindernia sp. 'India'\".

Rotala rotundifolia \"H'Ra\" / \"Gia Lai\" has narrow leaves and develops a nice light orange to red colour under good lighting. It has the same elegant growth habit as the light green Rotala rotundifolia \"Green\": overhanging to horizontal ramified stems. When combined with the \"Green\" variant, Rotala rotundifolia \"H'Ra\" will be especially effective. It differs from the similar Rotala rotundifolia \"Colorata\" by lighter-coloured narrower leaves and more overhanging stems when cultivated under the same conditions.",

Rotala rotundifolia \"H'Ra\" / \"Gia Lai\" has narrow leaves and develops a nice light orange to red colour under good lighting. It has the same elegant growth habit as the light green Rotala  rotundifolia \"Green\": overhanging to horizontal ramified stems. When combined with the \"Green\" variant, Rotala rotundifolia \"H'Ra\" will be especially effective.

However it resembles Rotala sp. \"Nanjenshan\" and possibly does not belong to the species Rotala wallichii. This plant is probably from tropical Asia. In its submerged form, it differs from R. sp. \"Nanjenshan\" by darker, more reddish coloration and upright growth. The shoots are up to about 5 cm wide. The submerged leaves are linear, to 1 mm wide and ca. 1,5-3 cm long, slightly tapering towards the tip. They are arranged in whorls of mostly 5 or 6. The upper side is light or medium green to yellowish or brown-red, the underside is pink. The stem is green and about 1,5 mm thick. The emersed plants have coarser, broader, light green leaves.\n\nAs well as Rotala wallichii, \"Long Leaf\" prefers rather soft water, good lighting, CO2 supply and regular, complete fertilization with macro and micro nutrients. Strong lighting provides the best reddish coloration of the foliage. Under good conditions, the growth is quite fast.

However it resembles Rotala sp. \"Nanjenshan\" and possibly does not belong to the species Rotala wallichii. This plant is probably from tropical Asia. In its submerged form, it differs from R. sp. \"Nanjenshan\" by darker, more reddish coloration and upright growth. The shoots are up to about 5 cm wide. The submerged leaves are linear, to 1 mm wide and ca. 1,5-3 cm long, slightly tapering towards the tip. They are arranged in whorls of mostly 5 or 6. The upper side is light or medium green to yellowish or brown-red, the underside is pink. The stem is green and about 1,5 mm thick. The emersed plants have coarser, broader, light green leaves.</p>\n<p>As well as Rotala wallichii, \"Long Leaf\" prefers rather soft water, good lighting, CO<sub>2</sub> supply and regular, complete fertilization with macro and micro nutrients. Strong lighting provides the best reddish coloration of the foliage. Under good conditions, the growth is quite fast.

Even though it is not quite easy in cultivation it is a highly popular plant.\n\nR. wallichii needs lots of light, CO2 fertilisation and a well-balanced supply of nutrients to grow well. The light intensity should at least be 0.5 watts per litre in order for it to attain intensive colours and to support growth. A good supply of CO2, either with bio CO2 or a system using pressure bottles is indispensable.

      "notes": "Sagittaria subulata originates from the east of the USA and from South-America, where it grows in fresh well as in brackish water. Especially in estuaries it has been known to form vast meadows. This arrowhead species is a longstanding, very popular aquarium plant cultivated by most of the major aquatic plant nurseries and regularly found in trade. Those plants sold under the name Sagittaria pusilla are said to stay smaller than \"normal\" S. subulata, however, there is reason to believe that they are not different from true S. subulata. Some nurseries also use the trade name \"Sagittaria teres\" or \"S. terres\". True S. teres, however, is a totally different species that probably isn't cultivated under aquarium conditions so far.\n\nS. subulata is very easy in cultivation, only needs moderate light and tolerates rather hard alkaline water.

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Seaside brookweed is a small, herbaceous plant from Europe, Asia and North America that belongs to the primrose family (Primulaceae). It is found in damp to occasionally flooded, often salty locations, usually near the sea coast, but also grows in fresh water. Under water, the plant forms a light green leaf rosette with obovate to spatulate leaves. It can then grow to around 10 - 15 cm high and 10 - 20 cm wide, but often remains smaller. In the land form and in very shallow water, an upright stem develops with small white flowers and seed capsules. Samolus valerandi has long been known in the aquarium hobby, also under the names Samolus floribundus and S. parviflorus.\n\nSamolus valerandi grows slowly under water and prefers strong lighting, nutrient-rich substrate and cooler temperatures below 26 °C in the aquarium. It is well adapted to hard water, but will still grow in soft water. Naturally a brackish water plant, it even tolerates a salt concentration of 30 mg/litre. In very shallow water and also with long-day lighting (more than 12 hours per day), stalks may form. The plant is easy to keep in an emersed environment and also self-seeds.\n\nThis unusual, small rosette plant can be used as an accent in the foreground. Samolus valerandi is suitable for well-lit aquaria, especially cold-water and brackish-water biotope tanks, as well as for paludaria in its terrestrial form.",
      "notes": "Seaside rivuletweed, or Samolus valerandi, is a small bog plant distributed in almost all the world. It prefers wet ground on and in fresh and brackish water. In Central Europe it can be found in brackish reeds near the coast, among others.\n\nThis plant has around 15 cm high light green spreading leaf rosettes. The leaves are oblanceolate to obovate and look a little like lamb's lettuce (Valerianella). The leaf tip is round, the margin runs down along the leaf stalk.\nThe flower stalks appear on emersed plants, grow to a height of 10 to 50 cm and carry alternate leaves that grow smaller to the top.

It is found in damp to occasionally flooded, often salty locations, usually near the sea coast, but also grows in fresh water. Under water, the plant forms a light green leaf rosette with obovate to spatulate leaves. It can then grow to around 10 - 15 cm high and 10 - 20 cm wide, but often remains smaller. In the land form and in very shallow water, an upright stem develops with small white flowers and seed capsules. Samolus valerandi has long been known in the aquarium hobby, also under the names Samolus floribundus and S. parviflorus.</p>\n\n<p>Samolus valerandi grows slowly under water and prefers strong lighting, nutrient-rich substrate and cooler temperatures below 26 °C in the aquarium. It is well adapted to hard water, but will still grow in soft water. Naturally a brackish water plant, it even tolerates a salt concentration of 30 mg/litre. In very shallow water and also with long-day lighting (more than 12 hours per day), stalks may form. The plant is easy to keep in an emersed environment and also self-seeds.</p>\n\n<p>This unusual, small rosette plant can be used as an accent in the foreground. Samolus valerandi is suitable for well-lit aquaria, especially cold-water and brackish-water biotope tanks, as well as for paludaria in its terrestrial form.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "description": "Description\n\nThe Greater duckweed stands out among the duckweeds due to its size and round shape. It is reminiscent of very small frogbit. Spirodela polyrhiza (also spelt S. polyrrhiza) is a true cosmopolitan; it occurs on all continents except Antarctica, from the temperate to the tropical climate zone. This floating plant grows in stagnant to slow-flowing, nutrient-rich, often somewhat shaded waters. Together with other duckweed species, it often forms a closed cover. The round fronds are about 0.5 to 1 cm in size. The upper side is light to medium green, with a reddish tinge in bright light. The underside is reddish to dark red and has a tuft of about 7 - 21 roots. New fronds sprout from \"pouches\" on the sides, which sooner or later detach. Under unfavourable conditions such as a lack of nutrients or frosty temperatures, the giant duckweed forms 2 - 3 mm wide, kidney-shaped, olive-coloured turions that sink to the bottom. These perennating buds sprout as soon as favourable growth conditions prevail again.\n\nSpirodela polyrhiza is a fairly easy plant, but like other aquarium floating plants it needs a good supply of nutrients, especially macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate, potassium), via the water. Moderate light intensity is sufficient. The plant is tolerant of different pH values and carbonate hardness levels.

It is reminiscent of very small frogbit. Spirodela polyrhiza (also spelt S. polyrrhiza) is a true cosmopolitan; it occurs on all continents except Antarctica, from the temperate to the tropical climate zone. This floating plant grows in stagnant to slow-flowing, nutrient-rich, often somewhat shaded waters. Together with other duckweed species, it often forms a closed cover. The round fronds are about 0.5 to 1 cm in size. The upper side is light to medium green, with a reddish tinge in bright light. The underside is reddish to dark red and has a tuft of about 7 - 21 roots. New fronds sprout from \"pouches\" on the sides, which sooner or later detach. Under unfavourable conditions such as a lack of nutrients or frosty temperatures, the giant duckweed forms 2 - 3 mm wide, kidney-shaped, olive-coloured turions that sink to the bottom. These perennating buds sprout as soon as favourable growth conditions prevail again.</p>\n\n<p>Spirodela polyrhiza is a fairly easy plant, but like other aquarium floating plants it needs a good supply of nutrients, especially macronutrients (nitrate, phosphate, potassium), via the water. Moderate light intensity is sufficient. The plant is tolerant of different pH values and carbonate hardness levels. Like other floating plants, it must be reduced occasionally so that it does not shade the plants below too much. Removal is much easier than with other, smaller duckweed species due to the relatively large fronds.

      "description": "Description\n\nTaxiphyllum barbieri is the most popular aquarium moss there is. It was confused with Vesicularia dubyana for a long time, therefore it is mostly called \"Java moss\"; another name is \"Bogor moss\". In the nature, it is only recorded from Vietnam so far. This tropical water moss forms long, irregularly branched, about 1,5 mm wide shoots that attach willingly to all kinds of surfaces, which makes it an ideal moss for accentuating the hardscape or for hiding technical equipment in the tank. With stronger lighting, it branches more, while its shoots get thin, thread-like and poorly ramified under low light. It grows fast for a moss; we have determined a growth rate of up to 3 - 4 cm per month.\n\nThe Java moss is very undemanding regarding water parameters and lighting, it grows with low or high carbonate hardness, pH values of about 5 - 8 and temperatures between 12 and 34 °C, however it looks best under good lighting and complete nutrient supply. It looks especially decorative when it is tied to driftwood; its fast growth makes regular trimming necessary. Make sure that it does not overgrow slowly growing epiphytes. This moss also grows emersed on constantly moist surfaces when the air humidity is high.\n\nAttached to hardscape or as a loose thicket, Taxiphyllum barbieri serves well as a natural hiding place and spawning substrate for the aquarium inhabitants. It is especially suitable for the nature aquarium style with its rather \"wild\" appearance.",

Often it is mistaken for Vesicularia dubyana, however, as early as 1982, the moss expert Zennosuke Iwatsuki identified \"Java moss\" he got from aquarists as Taxiphyllum barbieri. Some years ago, his results were published to a large audience (Benito C. Tan & al. 2004); in this publication, T. barbieri is called Java moss and the real Vesicularia dubyana is given the name Singapore moss.\nUnfortunately, the authors were unaware that the original \"Java moss\" cultivated in Europe over 50 years ago was indeed Vesicularia dubyana and that it was more or less completely supplanted by the faster-growing Taxiphyllum barbieri, which was introduced to the hobby later.\nG.

It was confused with Vesicularia dubyana for a long time, therefore it is mostly called \"Java moss\"; another name is \"Bogor moss\". In the nature, it is only recorded from Vietnam so far. This tropical water moss forms long, irregularly branched, about 1,5 mm wide shoots that attach willingly to all kinds of surfaces, which makes it an ideal moss for accentuating the hardscape or for hiding technical equipment in the tank. With stronger lighting, it branches more, while its shoots get thin, thread-like and poorly ramified under low light. It grows fast for a moss; we have determined a growth rate of up to 3 - 4 cm per month.</p>\n<p>The Java moss is very undemanding regarding water parameters and lighting, it grows with low or high carbonate hardness, pH values of about 5 - 8 and temperatures between 12 and 34 °C, however it looks best under good lighting and complete nutrient supply. It looks especially decorative when it is tied to driftwood; its fast growth makes regular trimming necessary. Make sure that it does not overgrow slowly growing epiphytes. This moss also grows emersed on constantly moist surfaces when the air humidity is high.</p>\n<p>Attached to hardscape or as a loose thicket, Taxiphyllum barbieri serves well as a natural hiding place and spawning substrate for the aquarium inhabitants. It is especially suitable for the nature aquarium style with its rather \"wild\" appearance.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

However, a DNA analysis (Les & al., 2008) has revealed that the Tiger Vallisneria is a variant of Vallisneria nana. This Australian species is quite variable and includes not only the well-known very narrow-leaved, but also quite large plants with similarly broad leaves as Vallisneria spiralis.\n\nThe Tiger Vallisneria is an excellent plant for beginners, growing in virtually all light and water conditions. The name is due to its leaves with a pattern of dark brown, short stripes. The leaves are about 30-60 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, light to middle green, also with red-brown tones under strong lighting. The Tiger Vallisneria forms runners easily, and is thus easy to propagate.",

However, a DNA analysis  (Les &amp; al., 2008) has revealed that the Tiger Vallisneria is a variant of Vallisneria nana. This Australian species is quite variable and includes not only the well-known very narrow-leaved, but also quite large plants with similarly broad leaves as Vallisneria spiralis.</p>\n<p>The Tiger Vallisneria is an excellent plant for beginners, growing in virtually all light and water conditions. The name is due to its leaves with a pattern of dark brown, short stripes. The leaves are about 30-60 cm long and 1-2 cm wide, light to middle green, also with red-brown tones under strong lighting. The Tiger Vallisneria forms runners easily, and is thus easy to propagate.</p></span>\n                                                \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                        </div>",

      "notes": "Vallisneria spiralis is one of the \"classic\" aquarium plants, known in the hobby since the beginnings of aquaristics. In nature it is distributed in stagnant and flowing waters in Africa, Asia and the warmer regions of Europe (e.g. Italy). Its species name \"spiralis\" does not refer to its leaf form but to its flower stalk, which starts spiralling after the female flower has withered (as it does in all Vallisneria species). Thus the infrutescence is drawn downward.\nThe plants sold as V. spiralis in trade can grow to very different lengths. However, in most cases plants with smooth (not spiralling) relatively narrow leaves are labeled V. spiralis. So-called \"V. spiralis\" imported from Malaysia have been identified as Vallisneria denseserrulata, a species native to Asia, recently differentiated from V. spiralis but very hard to know apart without flowers.\n\n- To be continued -\n\nComplete botanical name\tVallisnéria spirális L.\nFamily\tHydrocharitaceae\nGenus\tVallisneria\nDifficulty\tvery easy\nUsage\tBackground\nGrowth\tfast\npH value\t6 - 8\nTemperature tolerance\t5 - 30°C\nCarbonate hardness\t2 - 21°dKH\nGeneral hardness\t0 - 30°dGH\nPropagation\tRunners\nCan grow emersed?\tno\nSource\tFlowgrow",
