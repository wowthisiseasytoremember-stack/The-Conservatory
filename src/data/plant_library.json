      "description": "Acmella repens, the Oppositeleaf spotflower, is a little known, rare stem plant. It occurs as a swamp plant in the warmer parts of the Americas from the southern USA to Paraguay in several wet places and is able to grow submerged. Aquarists collected it in Texas years ago and discovered its suitability as aquarium plant. Since around 2012 it is also known in Europe. Acmella repens belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is closely related with the Pará cress or Jambú (Acmella oleracea). It resembles Gymnocoronis spilanthoides except that it is considerably smaller. In its suberged form it grows strictly upright with quite long internodes and opposite, egg-shaped, medium green leaves. Strong lighting causes red-brown coloration of the stems, petioles and leaf midribs. When it is allowed to grow out of the water, one may expect its nice little yellow inflorescences that resemble tiny sunflowers.",
      "notes": "Acmella repens is a plant from the Asteraceae family growing in the southeast of the USA, from Texas to North Carolina, as well as in Central and South America, from Mexico to Paraguaygeneralreferences#1. This relatively small plant with its yellow flowers occurs in disturbed, wet or drying-out locationsgeneralreferences#2. It belongs to the same genus as the medical/spice plant paracress or jambú (Acmella oleracea). Only a short time ago, aquaristis from the USA have discovered that Acmella repens, which they collected in Texas, can be cultivated submersed. Outside the USA it is hardly known as aquarium plant yet.- To be continued - (read more)",

The species A. reineckii is native to wetlands in tropical and subtropical South America, but we have no information about the exact origin of the \"Mini\" form.\nThis plant grows much more compactly under water and also somewhat slower than other A. reineckii forms. It can be pruned to form a beautiful, purple-red to brown-red coloured carpet or compact bush about 5 cm high and is then suitable for the aquarium foreground and nano aquariums. Without pruning, the plant will grow to around 20 cm high over time, but will remain quite bushy due to branching. The leaves can grow to around 5 cm long and 1.4 cm wide, but are often smaller. Many water roots grow on old stems, but these are unlikely to be visually disturbing due to the bushy growth of the plant.\nEmersed Alternanthera reineckii 'Mini' grows significantly taller (at least 30 cm) and more elongated than the submersed form, with longer internodes and more green leaves. Emersed potted plants from the trade therefore hardly differ from other A. reineckii cultivars. However, compact shoots with much shorter internodes develop under water.",

It got known in Europe around the year 2007; its exact origins are unclear. This plant is likely identical to Alternanthera reineckii 'Mini'. When cultivated emersed, A. reineckii \"rosaefolia minor\" looks pretty much like the emersed forms of other varieties of A. reineckii as it forms rather long stems with elongated internodes. Its stunning dwarfed growth habit with the stunted internodes is reserved for the submersed form, as it seems. (read more)",

Emersed plants supplied from nurseries can have much longer leaf stalks and be approx. 30 cm high. However, the newly developed underwater leaves generally remain significantly shorter.",
      "notes": "Anubias \"nangi\" is a hybrid of A. barteri var. nana and A. gilletii that was created in cultivation by Robert A. Gasser (1922-2002, former owner of \"Quality Aquarium Plants\" nursery, Florida). This plant has been in trade since 1986 im Handel, however, nowadays it is a little-known rarity.It differs from similar varieties of A. barteri as well as from A. heterophylla by a wide-lanceolate acuminate leaf form. The leaves are slightly bullous, shiny and of a dark green colour.A. \"nangi\" is a well-growing highly recommendable Anubias form with low demands on cultivation.- To be continued - (read more)",

Whereas it is almost identical to Anubias barteri var. nana, its small size and slower growth is often given as a reason for higher prices.Contrary to the opinion of some dealers the leaf blade of 'Petite' respectively 'Bonsai' may grow larger than 1 cm.

Even though this Bacopa species occurs in vast populations on rivers and lakeshores in South Brazil and Argentine, it was not described scientifically before the year 2001. Not much is known about its natural habitats, although, among others, major populations have been discovered in the enchantingly beautiful, crystal-clear calcareous rivers around Bonito, Brazil (Serra da Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul).This bushy-growing stem plant sports a tremendously intensive light shade of green.

However, Bucephalandra sordidula 'Blue' is very different from the B. sordidula form, which was introduced as Bucephalandra sp. \"Melawi\". It has a much broader, oval leaf shape and the leaf margin is barely wavy.\nThe submerged leaves of Bucephalandra sordidula 'Blue' have a distinct bluish colour. This plant is extremely easy to care for and thrives in different water values and light levels.",

      "description": "Like practically all Bucephalandras, \"Theia Green\" is primarily a perching plant on rock or wood. However, it can also be attached to the substrate, but do not bury the rhizome because it could rot. The roots will then grow into the substrate by themselves and the plant can benefit from the nutrients in the substrate. The plant develops most beautifully with medium light intensity and a constant supply of CO2 and nutrients. Growth is slow. Bucephalandras are propagated by cutting off side shoots or head shoots, which also promotes branching of the shoots.We recommend to put Bucephalandras into already cycled aquariums. It is best to leave the plants in peace so they can grow. Sudden changes of parameters may lead to shedding of leaves, normally, however, the plants regrow slowly and produce new shoots on the rhizome.",

C. lyrata grows well even without the addition of CO2, however, carbon dioxide fertilisation enhances growth. Leaf size seems to be dependent on temperature.

      "notes": "The triploid form of Cryptocoryne beckettii was originally described as a species on its own, namely Cryptocoryne petchii. However, this beautiful and very widely spread plant, which belongs in the C. wendtii group, is readily available and has been in use in aquaristics for over 60 years.It is very easy to cultivate, and possesses the typical characteristics of a Cryptocoryne from Sri Lanka. It adapts well to soft as well as to hard water, light is relatively unimportant, even though it grows better under more intensive light. The brown-green rosettes that form soon after the plant is placed in the tank spread quickly and form dense bushes. Nutrient-rich substrates enhance growth. The plant reacts nicely to ample fertilisation and to CO2, but it grows sufficiently well without these components, too. (read more)",

There it occurs in calcareous, shaded flowing waters, in contrast to the type variety Cryptocoryne cordata var. cordata, which occurs in acidic, soft waters on the Malay Peninsula. The variety siamensis is very variable in size, leaf shape and colouration, and in aquarium culture there are different forms. For example, the large, broad-leaved \"Cryptocoryne blassii\" was popular decades ago as an undemanding aquarium plant, but has become rare in the hobby today.\nThe form we offer (Dennerle abbreviation C30) is smaller and narrower-leaved than the form \"blassii\". It has lanceolate, somewhat shiny leaves with an attractive dark line pattern and reddish-purple underside. Especially under intense light, the plant hardly grows taller than 10 cm for a long time, with a spreading habit. After a long time, especially in low light and with plenty of nutrients, it can grow over 20 cm tall. The petioles are then often longer than the leaf blades, which are about 7 - 8 cm long. Through underground runners, Cryptocoryne cordata var. siamensis can form a lush, dense stand over time. In shallow water or in emersed culture, inflorescences with a long tube and yellow spathe blade may appear.",

It does not require additional CO2, however, CO2 fertilisation may have a positive effect on growth. It can be kept in hard water very well. In order to reach its full height it needs a substrate rich in nutrients.The emersed cultivation of C. cordata var. blassii is easy. It only needs low light and should be sprayed with water from time to time in order to increase the humidity. It also needs a nutrient-rich substrate when cultivated above the waterline.

It was described in 2013 as Cryptocoryne nurii var. raubensis, named after the district of Raub in the Malaysian state of Pahang. In nature, this variety occurs in rivers and streams with sand and gravel over limestone, in the same area as the well-known Cryptocoryne affinis. The type variety, Cryptocoryne nurii var. nurii, on the other hand, originates from soft, acidic, low-lime waters, e.g. peat swamp forests, and is clearly more demanding in cultivation. The ovate-lanceolate submerged leaves of C. nurii var. raubensis have a striking pattern: light, whitish to pinkish midrib and lateral veins on an olive green to reddish brown ground as well as dark transverse stripes. In cultivation there are several forms with slight differences; in 'Rosen Maiden' or 'Rozen Maiden' the longitudinal veins have stronger pink tones. The emersed leaves are usually broader ovate and rather inconspicuous green. The plant forms a flat, spreading rosette of leaves, about 20 - 30 cm wide and 10 cm high, as well as underground runners. Typical for var. raubensis are submerged inflorescences with an elongated stem (peduncle). In nature, this allows the spathe to reach the water surface and pollinating insects to reach the flowers on the spadix inside.",

Walker's water trumpet is a very variable species, and various forms are in the aquarium plant trade. Our plant forms intense purple-red leaves with dark stripes underwater. It is also supplied by aquatic plant nurseries as Crypocoryne lutea and incorrectly as Cryptocoryne wendtii \"Red\". The leaf rosette grows to a height of about 15 to 20 cm in the aquarium and is at least as wide. Over time, underground runners develop a dense stand.

The forms of C. x willisii are reminiscent of the tiny Cryptocoryne parva, but are larger and more vigorous. \nCryptocoryne x willisii \"nevillii\" has medium green underwater leaves, which can also show slightly reddish-brown tones. In the submerged form, the plant usually grows to a height of around 5 to 15 cm. Plants that have been supplied with plenty of nutrients and grown over a longer period of time can possibly reach a height of around 20 cm. However, this Cryptocoryne is usually sold in the terrestrial form (emersed form) and is then often up to around 25 cm high. However, the submerged leaves newly formed in the aquarium remain shorter.\nCryptocoryne x willisii \"nevillii\" differs from the similar C. x willisii \"lucens\" in having shorter, more ovate leaf blades.",

There are only a few aquatic Cuphea species, and C. anagalloidea is the first plant of the genus that is cultivated in aquaria.

      "description": "This very distinctive, relatively small Echinodorus cultivar was introduced in 1985 in the magazine Aqua Planta under the name Echinodorus parviflorus 'Tropica'. It was named after the nursery of the same name, Tropica, in Denmark. It possibly arose in a nursery in Asia by mutation from Echinodorus grisebachii 'Parviflorus' (then called Echinodorus parviflorus). The plant is also traded as 'Echinodorus mucronatus'. \nThe Tropica sword plant forms a compact, spreading rosette of many leaves over time. It often grows only about 5 to 10 cm high in the aquarium, but can reach a maximum of about 15 cm high and 33 cm wide. The leaves are somewhat reminiscent of those of Samolus valerandi, hence the name \"Samolus sword plant\". The underwater leaves are coarse, medium to dark green, somewhat hammered and narrowly obovate, i.e. widest above the middle. Towards the end they are rounded with a clearly separated point.",

Described as a species by Karel Rataj in 1970, it is likely a natural hybrid from the Echinodorus grandiflorus species group. There are different plants under that name, however our plant is a small form that is already cultivated since the 1970's as Echinodorus opacus. Due to its low propagation rate it is still a rarity. Only recently the name addition \"Rataj\" is used to designate this small E. opacus form.\nVery different from the many big, fast-growing Echinodorus types, this plant grows slow and hardly flowers. It developes a creeping rhizome and hard, stiff, dark green leaves with ovate blade. It is particularly attractive through its light nervature that contrasts with the darker leaf tissue.",

      "description": "Eriocaulon breviscapum has not been known as an aquarium plant for very long and is still a rarity. However, another plant is also available under the name \"E. breviscapum\", which is probably Eriocaulon periyarense. Our plant forms dense, grass-like bushes with submerged leaves that are 50–60 cm long and only 1.8 mm wide. The leaf rosette and roots sit on a 6-10 mm thick, ascending to upright rhizome. This forms daughter rosettes through branching, and over time a broad clump grows. Occasionally, inflorescences appear with a stem that remains shorter than the leaves and a head with many tiny grey-white flowers. With its narrow, flexible leaves, the plant resembles E. sp. \"Feather Duster\" and E. sp. \"Japan Needle Leaf\", but grows taller. Unlike \"Japan Needle Leaf\", it cannot attach itself to objects with its roots. \nEriocaulon breviscapum is endemic to the Western Ghats in south-west India, where it grows in shallow water in mountain rivers. It anchors itself in gravel and between boulders with its strong, long roots. Usually, only the inflorescences protrude from the water, while the long leaves float in the water.",

The rhizome branches out, forming a dense cluster of many individual shoots over time. The fine, flexible leaves are just over 30 cm long. If the plant grows in shallow water, relatively large head-shaped inflorescences with countless small grey-white flowers can push themselves above the surface of the water.

Its species identity is still unclear. It is certainly not native to Japan and resembles certain Eriocaulon species that occur in rocky beds of fast-flowing rivers in India. Its submerged leaves are flexible, dark green and smooth. They grow to a length of approx. 30-40 cm with a width of only 1.5 mm. The leaves are distichous, which means that they grow in two rows on the rhizome - quite uncommon for an Eriocaulon. The creeping, short, hard rhizome branches readily, forming a large, dense grass-like tuft with time. Sometimes, young leaves get stuck when sprouting and become wrinkled. They can be removed and are normally followed by straight leaves.\nInterestingly, this Eriocaulon attaches itself to solid material such as rock or wood. Therefore it seems likely that it occurs naturally on rock or in gravel in flowing waters.\nOccasionally inflorescences appear that remain shorter than the leaves. When they are able to grow out of shallow water, its flowerheads open, exposing many tiny greyish white flowers. When the heads remain submerged, they develop adventitious plantlets.",

This aquatic plant with striking, twisted leaves is a mutant of Helanthium bolivianum 'Angustifolius' (formerly known as Echinodorus angustifolius) and was selected in the Oriental nursery (Singapore). It has been commercially available since 2006. \nUnder water, upright, linear, approximately 4 mm wide, pointed, tightly twisted leaves develop, which are arranged in a rosette. They have a fresh, medium to dark green colour and are somewhat transparent. The plant can grow to a height of around 40 cm. In our aquaria, however, it has so far only grown to a height of around 25 cm, which is much lower than the parent form H. bolivianum ‘Angustifolius’, which is reminiscent of a long and narrow-leaved Vallisneria. Like other Helanthiums, the plant forms long runner ‘chains’ with many young plants, but the growth of the runners is nowhere near as rapid as that of 'Angustifolius'.\nThe Vesuvius sword plant is usually sold in its terrestrial (emersed) form. It then has shorter, broader, less and irregularly twisted, often almost straight leaves and often also inflorescences. The typical long, narrow, tightly twisted submersed leaves only sprout under water. Unsightly emersed leaves can be removed later.",

In Germany, the water violet or featherfoil is legally protected, and according to the German \"Red List\" of 1996, it is an endangered species there. Although still quite widely spread in the North German Plain, its overall populations are receding. Featherfoil e.g. grows in shaded, muddy-peaty ditches or on the edges of oxbow lakes, forming dense submersed populations. Only its beautiful flower stalks reach above the waterline in May and June. If the location falls dry, the plant forms low-growing, matlike emersed populations. It is a known medicinal plant in natural medicine. It is illegal to collect Hottonia palustris from the wild, however, it is readily available for ponds or aquariums in trade. (read more)",

One of the most important factors is light, as its height depends on light intensity. The more intense, the smaller the plant will stay. Apart from that, its demands regarding nutrients and CO2 supply are quite easy to meet. A balanced supply of nutrients and CO2 injection are beneficial to the plant's growth, though. However, if abundant nutrients are added, unfortunately the dwarfism so many hobbyists covet in this plant will disappear and it will grow much larger leaves. A striking difference to H.

      "notes": "Hygrophila difformis is a very beautiful plant, and has been in cultivation in the aquarium hobby for many years. It originates from South and South-East Asia, where it grows in boggy areas. In Asia the plant is used in traditional medicine.There are only few plants easier to cultivate in an aquarium than this one. It grows well under moderate light, however, more intensive lighting benefits its health and overall volume. Lots of light, CO2 injection and a good nutrient supply lead to enormous growth rates.This makes it a great plant for newly set-up tanks, as it can absorb large amounts of nutrients, thus helping to keep ammonium levels down. Its pinnate leaves grow more refinedly under lots of light. Parameters like water hardness and the pH do not play an important role for H. difformis, and it also grows very fast in tanks with no CO2 injection. (read more)",

In the emersed form, it is a strong marsh plant that grows to a height of almost one metre. The upright shoots have lanceolate leaves with entire margin and striking large blue-violet flowers in the upper leaf axils, which are somewhat reminiscent of sage (Salvia) flowers. The emersed stems and leaves are covered with sticky glandular hairs and have a strong odour, hence the species name H. odora. \nIn the submerged form, however, the plant is light green, hairless and has very decorative pinnately cut, narrow, almost fern-like leaves up to 10 cm long on tough stems. This Hygro species grows relatively slowly submerged and is well suited for moderately tall bushes in the aquarium midground.",

Under moderate light, it has a pleasant, freshly green colour, but it assumes a brown-red hue under intense lighting and good micronutrient supply.",
      "notes": "Even though other members of the rush family (Juncaceae) are popular plants for ponds or their edges, Juncus repens, the lesser creeping rush, is their only representative used in aquaria so far. Its habit is quite unique, as it looks like a mixture of stem and rosulate plant. Its flattish stem is interrupted by tufts of numerous narrow, pointed leaves in regular distances.This rush species is quite common the southeast of the US, where it is found growing emersed as well as submersed. Even though it is not frequently found in trade in its country of origin, it is readily available for European hobbyists.The overall requirements of J. repens are easy to meet, and the plant does well in a multitude of different setups, it grows equally well under low light as under strong light.

      "description": "Limnophila aromatica \"Mini\", also known as Limnophila sp. \"Kalimantan Mini\", has also been mistaken for Limnophila repens. This pretty dwarf form of Limnophila aromatica is still not very common and hardly available in the trade, although it has been known in Europe for over a decade. It usually has two to three, sometimes up to six leaves per stem node, which develop light green to brown-red tones in the underwater form. Underwater, the stomata are visible as tiny silvery dots on the leaves. The leaf midribs and stems often remain light green, creating a striking contrast to the leaf surfaces. The narrow lanceolate leaves have a serrated edge and vary in size depending on the growing conditions. They are often only 1 to 2.5 cm long. However, we have found that this Limnophila also develops leaves around 3 - 5 cm long and 4 - 6 mm wide under intensive lighting and with an abundant supply of CO2 and nutrients. The stem is about 2 mm thick, the stem nodes are about 2 cm apart. The plant can grow to over 30 cm tall, but looks best as a group about 10 to 20 cm high.\nConfusingly, another plant is also on the market under the name Limnophila aromatica \"Mini\". We call this plant, which is also relatively small, Limnophila cf. hippuridoides ‘Mini’. It has 4 - 7, usually 5 leaves per stem node.",
      "notes": "This small stem plant was first known as Limnophila sp. \"Mini\" and is also called L. sp. \"Kalimantan Mini\". It was taken for the species Limnophila repens, however, according to Kasselmann (2010), its flower characteristics match those of Limnophila aromatica. It is therefore a dwarf form of L. aromatica. We do not have reliable information about its origin, however the trading name \"Kalimantan Mini\" implies that the plant was probably found in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo island.",

When submerged in the aquarium, the growth of Lindernia rotundifolia depends on the conditions. In relatively low light, the shoots tend to grow strictly upright and branch little. Under intense light, they branch out quite strongly, forming a dense bush. The shoots can grow to a height of at least 40 cm, but tall, old bushes are often poorly rooted and can detach from the substrate.

      "description": "The Cardinal flower is actually a tall perennial with striking red flowers. However, it can also form an underwater form and is a classic among aquarium plants. Lobelia cardinalis is native to a wide area from southeastern Canada and the USA through Central America to northern South America (Colombia), where it grows in damp to swampy locations. Its tubular flowers appear in late summer and are visited by hummingbirds.\nIn its underwater form, this lobelia is a compact stem plant. The stem, which is up to around 7 mm thick, is densely covered with elliptical leaves that are 5 to 10 cm long and 2 to 2.7 cm wide with a petiole. While the leaves are rather dark green or reddish in the terrestrial form, the submerged plant has light to medium green leaves. The individual shoots grow to around 10-30 cm high and 5-16 cm wide.",
      "notes": "Lobelia cardinalis, the cardinal flower, is a true American, a native plant originally found in the eastern and central regions of the United States on moist ground alongside rivulets, ponds and road ditches. Its emersed form sports green leaves with a purple underside and attractive scarlet bell-shaped flowers, which make it a very popular and beautiful ornamental plant in its land of origin. The submersed plant is of a light green, though. L. cardinalis has been used for Dutch-style aquaria for a long time, and is quite widely spread in trade. L. cardinalis is an easy plant to care for. Lighting should be moderate at least, whereas higher wattage results in more compact, lusher growth. CO2 injection is not necessary, but still recommendable for strong healthy growth. Regular doses of liquid fertiliser are a means to determine the plant's overall size. (read more)",

It grows creeping in its terrestrial form, therefore its name, while its underwater stems are loosely upright or slanted and ramified. This species is very variable. Our tissue-cultured plant is an old strain of typical L. repens that was already cultivated in the former GDR. Its elliptic to roundish submerged leaves are about 2 to 3,5 cm long. With moderate ligting, their upper sides show olive green to orange tones. The underside of the leaves is light purple to wine-red. The plant can also develop a strong light red coloration under intense light.",

It frequently forms dense trailing populations in the shallow water, whose shoot tips grow over the water surface. In nature, L. repens is a highly variable (polymorph) species and hybridises easily with other Ludwigia species, which makes scientific identification of the various local forms very difficult.Ludwigia repens is among the most common aquarium plants world-wide. There are several forms of this species in trade. An especially colourful variety with round leaves is sold under the name \"Ludwigia mesakana\" or \"mesacana\".

      "notes": "Mayaca fluviatilis, or stream bogmoss, is distributed in the subtropical and tropical areas of the Americas, from the southeast of the USA to Argentine. This finely-structured mosslike stem plant grows emersed as well as submersed and is frequently found on the banks of blackwater rivulets. M. fluviatilis is quite variable, there are various forms with slightly differing characteristics. In the aquarium it prefers soft water with an acidic pH, however, it can be kept in harder water, too. It is a great indicator plant for iron - in the case of a deficiency, its shoot tips fade to a very pale green, which can easily be remedied by supplementing iron, though A well-balanced nutrient supply is very important for its cultivation. It also needs ample CO2 and good lighting. (read more)",

The limp but relatively tensile stem is whitish-green, about 0.5 - 0.8 mm thick and densely covered with alternate leaves. The gradually pointed leaves are very fine and delicate, about 1 cm long and less than half a millimetre wide. They have light olive-green to reddish tones and a red midrib. Typically, the leaves look somewhat \"wrinkled\". The shoot tips are pink. The plant can probably also develop a terrestrial form (emersed form) and should then flower, like other Mayaca species.

Submerged, the stems grow flat-bushy to creeping in plenty of light and form a dense, flat cushion. In moderate light, the shoots grow rather upright, strongly branched and loosely in all directions, the leaves then becoming up to 20 mm long and 1-2 mm wide.

The leaves are usually simple (undivided), but old, vigorous plants can occasionally develop one or two narrow lobes at the base of the leaf blade.\nA special feature of the Orange Java fern is that the relatively thin, long rhizomes tend to grow upright at an angle.

In the submersed form, the leaves are of a very light green, often with some purple hues. When nutrients are deficient, the leaves tend to assume a whitish colour. A substrate rich in nutrients and fertilisation with macronutrients is very beneficial for growth.

Forms with splendid red-brown spotted and striped underwater leaves, also known as Nymphaea zenkeri, have long been introduced from West Africa and are the most popular aquarium water lilies in the aquarium hobby as ‘tiger lotus’. The leaves and roots sprout from a tuberous rhizome. Although the tiger lotus also forms floating leaves typical of water lilies, it can be kept submerged in the aquarium. It quickly grows into a solitary plant up to approx. 50 cm high and wide and therefore needs plenty of space.\nThere are forms with different basic colouring of the underwater leaves. More red-leaved plants are differentiated from green tiger lotus as red tiger lotus. However, many tiger lotus plants in the trade are intermediate forms with different reddish to rather green tones and cannot be clearly assigned to one of the two ‘varieties’. The red colouring is also influenced by the light intensity.\nUnfortunately, we cannot offer our Nymphaea lotus plants selected by colour form. They show different shades of red and green.\nNymphaea lotus is a night-blooming waterlily species and can also flower in the aquarium, especially if the plant has developed floating leaves. The beautiful white, fragrant flowers rise above the water level and are open in the evening until the morning.",

Nymphaea rubra is often called ‘Dwarf Water Lily’ in the aquarium trade, but this is a misnomer. The submerged plant grows to a height of at least 30 cm. The underwater leaves have at least 20 cm long brown-red blades with a few small dark red spots. The petioles of the submerged leaves are up to about 20 cm long. Vigorous plants soon develop floating leaves with 30 to 70 cm long petioles. The round floating leaves are dark red when they emerge, later turning olive green and have blades about 20 - 40 cm long (usually smaller in aquariums). The margin of the floating leaves is more or less toothed. The rhizome is a tuber.",

      "description": "The Colombian water fringe was only introduced to Europe a few years ago. It soon turned out to be a magnificent aquarium plant that is comparatively easy to care for. However, it is still a little-known rarity in the aquarium hobby. Nymphoides flaccida has so far only been found in the Departamento Meta in the Llanos region of Colombia. It grows there in fast-flowing streams with a gravel and boulder substrate. Unlike many other Nymphoides species, the underwater leaves of N. flaccida are not waterlily-like and roundish, but elongated, almost ribbon-shaped. They have approx. 10 - 12 cm long blades on approx. 12 to over 25 cm long petioles. With its leaf shape, this aquatic plant is vaguely reminiscent of the tropical seaweed Caulerpa prolifera. The species name flaccida ( = limp) refers to the soft texture of the leaves. \nThe fresh, light green, loose leaf rosettes grow to a height of around 20 to 40 cm in our aquaria and have a short, thin rhizome.\nNymphoides flaccida shares a special way of propagation with other Nymphoides species: a young plant (adventitious plant) with roots apparently sprouts laterally from the leaf stalk about 1 cm below the leaf blade. In fact, these are not long-stalked leaves, but independent side shoots with a bud and a short-stalked leaf at the end. If such a shoot floats on the surface of the water, flowers can sprout from the bud before the adventitious plant appears. If the shoot remains under water, only the adventitious plant will develop. The delicate, white flowers with five narrow, finely fringed petals give the plant an additional decorative touch.",

The plant can quickly reach a height and width of 25 cm in the aquarium and grow to a maximum height of about 60 cm. It grows so fast that regular thinning of the leaves is necessary so that other plants are not shaded too much. When doing so, you remove the oldest leaves with the longest stalks.

It appeared spontaneously among mosses in an aquascape that was created with plants and materials from the company ADA. Pellia endiviifolia is widespread in the northern hemisphere, mostly in moist to wet, calcareous and nutrient-rich places, e.g. springs, streambanks and waterfalls in limestone areas. Mostly it is found above water, sometimes also submerged.\nThe underwater form of Pellia endiviifolia resembles Monosolenium tenerum in size and structure but it is a little smaller, lighter green and more transparent. It differs from the \"Subwassertang\", Lomariopsis cf. lineata, by thicker, lighter, less rounded thalli and presence of a midrib.

During the last years it has been used in many aquaria - mainly in the USA, but increasingly in Europe, too. At first glance, it looks a lot like Rotala verticillaris and some varieties of R. mexicana, however, its submersed growth differs from both by its more strictly upright growth habit and overall larger dimensions. Its emersed form makes the differences even clearer: whereas R. verticillaris and R. mexicana, both belonging to the Lythraceae family, have rather inconspicuous flowers sitting in the leaf axils, Pogostemon erectus, of the Lamiaceae family, shows highly distinct, decorative flower spikes with violet flowers, quite similar to those of the other Pogostemon species known.

Their appearance also depends strongly on the culture conditions, but they do differ under the same growth conditions. A finer and a coarser form are frequently found on the market. We call the coarser form provisionally Riccia fluitans \"Broad\". As well as the finer form, it has relatively long thallus branches, which, however, clearly differ in width. Between two bifurcations, the branches are about 8-9 mm long and 1,2 mm broad.",

At the moment is it labeled as Ammania sp. \"Bonsai\" and Rotala sp. \"Bonsai\" as the trade names, but its flowers have helped identify it correctly as R. indica. The name Rotala indica has been known in the aquarium hobby for a long time, but it was erroneously used for the totally different species Rotala rotundifolia. The unique appearance of Rotala indica can best be described as compact miniature version of Bacopa caroliniana. R. indica is a slow grower; under a lot of light, the shoot tips and stems turn reddish. With its straight hardly ramified thick stems and its roundish leaves it is best planted in a group in the fore- or middle ground of a tank. Rotala indica is especially suitable for smaller aquaria, but a large group of this plant may look nice in a bigger tank, too. Good lighting (at least 0.5 W/litre) and an ample supply of CO2 and nutrients need to be made sure. Moreover, R. indica should not be planted in the shade.",
      "notes": "There is quite a bit of confusion around the name Rotala indica in aquaristics. The reason for this is, that in 1960, Rotala rotundifolia was imported under the erroneous name \"Rotala indica\". Even today, especially reddish forms of the very variable R. rotundifolia are sold as \"Rotala indica\" in trade. True R. indica, however, is a competely different species that does not play a very important role as aquarium plant. Only recently, the plant sold as \"Ammannia sp. 'Bonsai' \" has been identified as true Rotala indica. It was also confused with Lindernia sp. \"India\". Rotala indica is widely spread in the warmer regions of Asia and is very often found as annual weed in rice paddies. It has been introduced into other regions of the earth where rice is cultivated, e.g. in Northern Italy.The emersed as well as the submersed forms of R. indica differ distinctly from R. (read more)",

Moderate light leads to its \"typical\" habit with longish, rather light green leaves and reddish stems. The leaf margins are then distinctly sawed, the leaf tip is obtuse.Under more intensive light, though, the leaves attain a reddish hue, and shoots may form whose leaf forms vary from ovate to round with a smooth margin.

As aquarium plant, R. rotundifolia was first introduced under the erroneous name of Rotala indica around the year 1960, a confusion lasting to this date and creating possible mistakes, as the true Rotala indica (which differs considerably from Rotala rotundifolia) was also introduced to the hobby several years ago. The latter, however, was first imported under the trade name \"Ammannia sp. 'Bonsai'\", and, even earlier, due to a mix-up, mistakenly as \"Lindernia sp. 'India'\". (read more)",

A good supply of CO2, either with bio CO2 or a system using pressure bottles is indispensable. Rotala wallichii grows best if the nitrate level never falls to zero but does not exceed 10 to 15 mg per litre either.

The leaves, which are about 3 cm long and 1 mm wide, are somewhat broader than the thread-thin leaves of \"normal\" Rotala wallichii and are lighter in colour. The colouring ranges from light green to light red and is very changeable depending on light intensity and nutrient supply, so the shoots within a stand may differ slightly in colour from one another.

This floating plant grows in stagnant to slow-flowing, nutrient-rich, often somewhat shaded waters. Together with other duckweed species, it often forms a closed cover. The round fronds are about 0.5 to 1 cm in size. The upper side is light to medium green, with a reddish tinge in bright light. The underside is reddish to dark red and has a tuft of about 7 - 21 roots. New fronds sprout from \"pouches\" on the sides, which sooner or later detach. Under unfavourable conditions such as a lack of nutrients or frosty temperatures, the giant duckweed forms 2 - 3 mm wide, kidney-shaped, olive-coloured turions that sink to the bottom. These perennating buds sprout as soon as favourable growth conditions prevail again.",

      "description": "The \"eelgrass\", Vallisneria spiralis, is one of the longest known, yet popular aquarium plants. This submerged plant has a wide distribution in Africa and the warmer parts of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, extended stands in lakes and rivers by its runners. The strap-shaped leaves are light to medium green, slightly transparent and about 5-15 mm wide. They vary greatly in length, one may expect a maximum length of 60 cm or more. Besides straight-leaved plants there are also forms with spirally twisted leaves. However this species is not named after such leaves but after the stalks of the female flowers that twist after flowering, as well as in other Vallisneria species. Also typical of the genus, long runners with \"chains\" of numerous plants arise from the leaf rosettes.",
      "notes": "Vallisneria spiralis is one of the \"classic\" aquarium plants, known in the hobby since the beginnings of aquaristics. In nature it is distributed in stagnant and flowing waters in Africa, Asia and the warmer regions of Europe (e.g. Italy). Its species name \"spiralis\" does not refer to its leaf form but to its flower stalk, which starts spiralling after the female flower has withered (as it does in all Vallisneria species). Thus the infrutescence is drawn downward.The plants sold as V. spiralis in trade can grow to very different lengths. However, in most cases plants with smooth (not spiralling) relatively narrow leaves are labeled V. spiralis. So-called \"V. spiralis\" imported from Malaysia have been identified as Vallisneria denseserrulata, a species native to Asia, recently differentiated from V. spiralis but very hard to know apart without flowers.- To be continued - (read more)",
