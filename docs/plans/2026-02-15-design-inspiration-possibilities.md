# The Conservatory: Design Inspiration & Visual Direction Possibilities

**Date**: 2026-02-15
**Status**: DESIGN EXPLORATION (Informing Final Visual Direction)
**Purpose**: Document visual direction options and contenders for the illustration system

---

## STRONG CONTENDER #1: Split-Screen Scientific + Artistic (★★★★★)

**Reference**: American Flagfish (*Jordanella floridae*) — Split illustration aesthetic

**Visual Approach**:
- **Left side**: Clean ink sketch with anatomical detail (Darwin field journal energy)
- **Right side**: Same organism with watercolor coloring + habitat context
- **Connection**: Both sides linked, showing progression from scientific sketch to finished art
- **Typography**: Serif headers, italic scientific names in small caps

**Example Use Cases**:

1. **Organism Placard**:
   - Left: Anatomical sketch (shows structure, rigor)
   - Right: Colored illustration (shows beauty, context)
   - User can toggle between views or see both

2. **Individual Organism Card**:
   - Display full split-screen on tablet/desktop
   - Display colored-only on mobile (sketch available on tap)

3. **Ecosystem Spread**:
   - All organisms rendered in colored style (right side approach)
   - Scientific rigor maintained through anatomical accuracy

4. **Compendium/Printed Cards**:
   - Split-screen format is ideal for print (teaches scientific illustration)
   - Fits perfectly on 4x6 or 3x5 card stock

**Pros**:
- ✓ Communicates "rigorous science + artistic beauty" immediately
- ✓ Darwin + Nat Geo hybrid perfectly
- ✓ Both sides are independently useful (sketch for study, color for inspiration)
- ✓ Works across all screen sizes (flexible layout)
- ✓ Excellent for print/physical products
- ✓ Establishes clear design language (left = sketch method, right = color method)
- ✓ Makes scientific accuracy VISIBLE (anatomy shown in sketch side)
- ✓ Very shareable and collectible aesthetic

**Cons**:
- ✗ Takes more space/time to generate both sides
- ✗ Mobile display might feel cramped (need responsive design)
- ✗ More complex to animate (would need to sketch left side, then color right side)

**Design Language Implications**:
- Sketch side defines line weight, stroke quality, anatomical approach
- Color side shows watercolor technique, palette application, habitat context
- Every organism should have consistent sketch style (left) and coloring approach (right)

**Recommendation**: **STRONG YES** — This immediately solves the "system consistency" problem. The sketch side becomes the template; the color side becomes the final product.

## Contender #2: Full-Color Watercolor Only (★★★★)

**Visual Approach**:
- Single finished illustration (no sketch side)
- Watercolor wash + clean ink linework
- Habitat context integrated into composition
- Muted, scientific color palette

**Example**:
```
Neon Tetra in mid-water, schooling composition,
watercolor washes (cool blues, muted greens),
clean ink outlines,
water substrate and plants providing context,
labeled with common + scientific name
```

**Pros**:
- ✓ Simpler to generate (one image per organism)
- ✓ Clean, uncluttered aesthetic
- ✓ Faster iteration and less storage
- ✓ Works well for ecosystem spreads (less cognitive load)
- ✓ Mobile-friendly (single image fills screen nicely)

**Cons**:
- ✗ Doesn't show the "rigorous science" side as clearly
- ✗ Loses the Darwin field journal sketch element (less unique)
- ✗ Less educational (anatomy not as visible)
- ✗ Doesn't establish a clear "system" (harder to replicate)

**Design Language Implications**:
- All organisms same approach, less variation possible
- Harder to show anatomical differences across species

**Recommendation**: **GOOD FALLBACK** if split-screen becomes too complex, but loses some of the magic.

---

## Contender #3: Watercolor + Anatomical Labels (Museum Placard Style) (★★★)

**Visual Approach**:
- Full watercolor illustration with no sketch side
- Clean, elegant composition
- Anatomical labels overlaid (arrows, callouts)
- Museum placard aesthetic (like natural history exhibits)

**Example**:
```
Betta fish in full color,
anatomical labels pointing to key features:
  - Gill flap structure
  - Fin ray count
  - Scale pattern
- Serif typography for labels
- Muted color palette with habitat context
```

**Pros**:
- ✓ Educational (shows anatomy without sketch)
- ✓ Single image, simpler generation
- ✓ Museum-quality aesthetic
- ✓ Works for both casual and deep-dive users

**Cons**:
- ✗ Labels can clutter composition
- ✗ Doesn't have the "sketch progression" uniqueness
- ✗ Feels more like a field guide than Nat Geo (less cinematic)

**Recommendation**: **GOOD SUPPLEMENT** — Use for trait dashboard or detailed placard view, not primary organism illustration.

---

## Contender #4: Stylized Illustration (Character Design Approach) (★★)

**Visual Approach**:
- More graphic, less photorealistic than watercolor
- Bolder colors, cleaner lines
- Character design energy (like animation or graphic novels)
- Still scientific, but more illustrated

**Pros**:
- ✓ Distinctive, memorable aesthetic
- ✓ Works well for smaller organisms (shrimp, snails)
- ✓ Very animated-friendly (can move/animate easily)

**Cons**:
- ✗ Less "museum placard" feeling
- ✗ Might feel too playful for the reverent tone
- ✗ Harder to maintain scientific accuracy with stylization

**Recommendation**: **NOT PREFERRED** for primary direction, but could work as secondary style for specific organism types (invertebrates?).

---

## Contender #5: Hybrid Approach (Sketch + Anatomical Labels + Color) (★★★★)

**Visual Approach**:
- Left: Sketch with anatomical callouts (hybrid of #1 and #3)
- Right: Full color illustration
- Labels in both sides showing structure + final appearance

**Pros**:
- ✓ Most educational
- ✓ Shows anatomy AND color
- ✓ Extremely Audubon/Darwin aesthetic

**Cons**:
- ✗ Complex to generate
- ✗ Could feel crowded
- ✗ Harder to animate

**Recommendation**: **POSSIBLE FUTURE ENHANCEMENT** after nailing the split-screen approach.

## RECOMMENDATION: GO WITH SPLIT-SCREEN (#1)

**Why**:
1. **System Clarity**: Left side = design template, Right side = final output. Every new organism teaches consistency.
2. **Emotional Impact**: Progression from rigorous science → artistic beauty mirrors the user journey (learning → wonder)
3. **Educational**: Shows anatomy (sketch) + beauty (color) without feeling like a textbook
4. **Shareable**: Perfect for Instagram, prints, compendium cards, museum placard energy
5. **Future-Proof**: Sketch side can be animated (invisible hands drawing), colored side can be static or interactive
6. **Alignment**: Perfectly bridges Darwin field journal + Nat Geo magazine + BBC Planet Earth

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH (For Split-Screen)

### Phase 1: Single Organism Test
Generate 3-5 organisms in split-screen format:
- Neon Tetra (*Hyphessobrycon innesi*)
- Java Fern (*Microsorum pteropus*)
- Amano Shrimp (*Caridina japonica*)
- Betta (*Betta splendens*)
- Anubias (*Anubias barteri*)

**Goal**: Establish consistent sketch style and watercolor method across diverse organism types.

### Phase 2: System Documentation
- Document line weight standards (primary outlines, secondary details, labels)
- Document watercolor technique (wash order, color mixing, brush approach)
- Document composition rules (focal point, supporting context, empty space)
- Create template for AI image generator: "Make this organism in The Conservatory split-screen style"

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
- Generate full habitat diorama using right-side (colored) approach only
- All organisms rendered with consistent coloring method
- Habitat shows ecosystem relationships

### Phase 4: Animation Planning
- Left side (sketch) animates as "invisible hands drawing"
- Right side (color) fades in or animates sequentially
- Transitions between organisms use sketch animation

## IMAGE GENERATION PROMPT (For Split-Screen)

```
ORGANISM: [Name]
STYLE: Split-screen scientific illustration

LEFT SIDE (Sketch):
- Clean ink linework with anatomical detail
- Grayscale, no color
- Darwin field journal aesthetic
- Shows bone/muscle structure, fin ray count, scale patterns, anatomical features
- High level of anatomical accuracy
- Bold, confident strokes
- Hand-drawn appearance

RIGHT SIDE (Colored):

- Common name: Serif, 14-16px
- Connected layout showing progression from sketch to final art
- Cream/off-white background
- Film grain texture overlay 2-5%
- Consistent with all other Conservatory organism illustrations

NOT: Photorealism, AI-generated photos, 3D rendering, generic illustration
```

## NEXT STEPS

**Before committing to split-screen approach:**

1. Generate 2-3 test organisms in split-screen format
2. Review for:
   - Sketch side clarity (anatomy shows well?)
   - Color side beauty (watercolor technique consistent?)
   - Typography alignment (names/labels match vision?)
   - System applicability (could this template work for 100+ organisms?)
3. Test mobile display (does it work on small screens?)
4. Test print output (would this look good as 4x6 card?)

**If tests pass**: Lock in split-screen as primary design direction.

**If tests reveal issues**: Fallback to color-only watercolor (#2) while maintaining system goals.

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY LOCK-IN

Whichever direction wins, the core principle is **consistent design language**:

> *"Every organism in The Conservatory should feel like it was illustrated by the same artist, in the same studio, on the same mission: to show the beauty AND the science of these creatures."*

The split-screen approach makes that mission visual from day one.
